**Study of the US Institutes for Student leaders (SUSI)**

In 2019 I was selected to represent Europe in 5-week, fully funded, highly competitive program for young leaders. The program included coursework, company visits, and travel, examining entrepreneurial approaches and economic development in USA.

**Living in Philadelphia**

While my arrival at University of Pennsylvania during the pandemic was challenging, I have managed to adapt, expand my network and blend in with the culture. I was also lucky enough to find cool housemates that helped make the most out of it.
