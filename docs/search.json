It is designed specifically for them and it works like Google maps. Great navigation tool while you are in Denmark. There will be machines (also a person for support) at the airport where you can buy tickets. Also, Denmark is infamous for cycling with great infrastructure. You can rent bikes as well and ride across the city."

    "text": "COOL VISITS\nNyhavn (The most iconic part of Copenhagen. Highly recommended. the Closest metro station: Kongens Nytorv station.)\n\n\n\nNyhavn\n\n\n\nSomething you can do is to walk through the shopping center of Copenhagen. You can go to Norreport station and walk towards Nyhavn. It is like a 1 to 1.5 mile (1.6–2.4km) walk. There are many stores and restaurants in between (along the yellow line on the map). While it is not a straightforward walk it is a pleasant one as you are passing through the shopping area of the city.\n\n\nRosenborg Castle & Botanical Garden (Nice places to walk around. Also, Rosenborg castle is a historic place that now operates as a museum ticket info. Have no opinion for the museum though as I haven’t been. Closest metro station: Norreport station)\nLittle Mermaid (You will often see it in souvenir shops as it is considered as one of the main attraction points in Copenhagen along Nyhavn. While you might not be impressed by it due to its tiny size, you may want to see it simply for its touristic outreach.) Osterport Station.\nAmalienborg (The equivalent ‘Buckingham palace’ of Denmark. Cool for walking around and taking pictures with the royal guards. Have no opinion for the museum there though as I haven’t been. tick info)\nCarlsberg Factory (if you like beer this is a nice place to visit. There is a tour in the factory and some beer tasting in the end. Carlsberg Station.)\nTivoli Gardens/Park (Located in front of the Central Station. The most famous park in Copenhagen. Kobenhavn H station)\nFisketorvet (If you like Malls, this can be an option. Most famous mall in the city.)\nBlack Diamond (The largest library in Denmark. It is a modern building. A Nice place to visit. Christianshavn station.)"

It is a renowned marijuana place since Christiania is the only part of Copenhagen where Danish law is not enforced. However, it is a safe area that is worth a visit mainly due to its particularity. Highly recommended.) Metro station: Christianshavn.\nBeautiful Parks (especially for summer walks):\n\n\nFrederiksberg Have (One of the most beautiful parks in Copenhagen) Frederiksberg station.\nSuperkilen Park (Norrebro station). Fun fact, Norrebro is an area where many immigrants stay. Diverse area.\nVestre Kirkegard (near Carlsberg factory) Metro: Carlsberg Station\n\nFOOD & COOL PLACES (min $ /max $$$$)\n\nUnion Kitchen $$ (Cool place for brunch. Heard great things from friends that have been there.)\nSticks’n’Sushi $$$ (Great sushi place. Known rooftop restaurant in the city.)\nDalle Valle $ (variety food buffet - alue for money place with plenty of food) Not fast food, but not a high-class restaurant. Almost always lots of people, decent food, a variety of options. Recommended for lunch.\nConditori La Glace $$$ (Traditional Danish pastries, it is the oldest patisserie in Denmark - founded in 1870, good for dessert)\nEspresso House $$ (coffee place, despite its Swedish origin it is considered as the ‘Starbucks’ of Denmark)\nBastard cafe $$ (a place full of board games. A nice place to go with friends for coffee/snacks/beer and board games.\nTaphouse $$ (Famous bar in the city. If you like beer then this is the place for you. It has one of the largest beer selections in Europe.)\n\nYou can always map your choices and combine visits that are close to each other. Also, since it is Scandinavia, remember to check the weather while preparing your bags! You are visiting arguably the most beautiful city in Scandinavia so try to enjoy every minute of it!\nHave fun and safe travels!"

What are the summary statistics for all draws? Plot a histogram. Are there any outliers in the data (i.e. individuals who guess 0 times correctly and individuals who guessed all 20 times correctly?)\nwe draw a histogram based on the summary statistics. To find\n\nlibrary(readxl)\nexp21 <- read_excel(\"experiment_2021C(1)copy.xlsx\", col_names = FALSE,\n    skip = 2)\n\nNew names:\n* `` -> ...1\n* `` -> ...2\n* `` -> ...3\n* `` -> ...4\n* `` -> ...5\n* ...\n\n\nI find all the outcome columns and I name them after the variable names of our dataset.\n\nvar_names <- read_excel(\"experiment_2021C(1)copy.xlsx\", n_max = 1) \n\nNew names:\n* `Q171_First Click` -> `Q171_First Click...46`\n* `Q171_Last Click` -> `Q171_Last Click...47`\n* `Q171_Page Submit` -> `Q171_Page Submit...48`\n* `Q171_Click Count` -> `Q171_Click Count...49`\n* `Q171_First Click` -> `Q171_First Click...82`\n* ...\n\ncolnames(exp21) <- colnames(var_names)\n\nrm(var_names) \n\ncolumnss <- exp21 %>% \n  select(starts_with(\"Outcome\"), \"Age\", \"Risk\", \"Gender\", \"SC0\") \n\nNow we pivot longer to have all the outcomes in line. This helps to name the correct answers as “1” and the wrong answers as “0”.\n\ncountcol <- columnss %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Outcome\"), names_to= \"draw\", values_to = \"answer\") %>%\n  mutate(count= case_when(answer == \"Yes (bonus payment of $0.10)\" ~ 1,\n         answer == \"No (no bonus payment)\" ~ 0))\n\nAfter we pivot wider back in its first format. This helps us to have the data\n\npilpi <- countcol %>% select(-answer) %>% mutate(id = rep(1:133, each = 20)) %>%  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(id, Age, SC0, Risk, Gender), names_from = draw, values_from = count)\n\nWe use pivot longer once more in order to have all the observations in one column. Having the observations in one column, is easier for us to group by the id column we created before. So we groupby id. This helps us identify what each person done. In addition, we add a column using mutate in order to have the clear result of each person.\n\npi <- pilpi %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"Outcome\"), names_to= \"draw\", values_to = \"answer\") %>% group_by(id) \n\nti<- pi %>% mutate(summm=sum(answer))\n\ntii<- pi %>% mutate(summm=sum(answer)) %>% separate(draw, into = c(\"rolsep\", \"rolnum\"), sep = \"e\") %>% group_by(id)\n\n# boxplot.stats(data$score)$out\n# \n# rr <- ti %>% separate(draw, into = c(\"rolsep\", \"rolnum\"), sep = \"e\") %>% group_by(id, rolnum)\n\nNow we pivot wider once more so the data can be presented in the form that shows how people are doing from the 1st one until the last (133rd).\n\nfinal <- ti %>%  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(id, Age, SC0, Risk, Gender, summm), names_from = draw, values_from = answer)\n\n# finally <- tii %>%  pivot_wider(id_cols = c(id, Age, SC0, Risk, Gender, summm), names_from = rolnum, values_from = answer)\n# \n#   fin <- final %>% inner_join(ex22, by = \"id\")\n\nWe use the code below to do our Histogram.\n\nggplot(final, aes(summm)) + geom_histogram(bins = 21) + geom_rug()\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze the data by gender, the draw number, and by experimental condition. Are there differences between the genders in terms of the number of wins versus losses? Are there differences between the experimental conditions? Are people more or less likely to win towards the last draws as opposed to the beginning of the experiment?\n‘Final’ is the column that already has everything needed for the analysis. The only missing column is conditions. To do that, I used mutate to create a new column named as condition where each real condition is named after a number from one to five. I also create an id column in the ex2 dataset so I can then inner_join it with our main column.\n\nex2 <- exp21 %>%\n         mutate(condition = case_when(Control_Msg != \"\" ~ 1,\n                               Norm_Pos_Msg != \"\" ~ 2,\n                               Norm_Neg_Msg != \"\" ~ 3,\n                               Emp_Neg_Msg != \"\" ~ 4,\n                               Emp_Pos_Msg != \"\" ~ 5),\n                id = 1:133,\n                rolnum = 1:133) \n\nAt this point, I create a new dataset with ‘id’ and ‘condition’ columns so it is easier to inner_join them. Then I inner_join them so I have everything in one dataset named ‘fin’.\n\nex22 <- ex2 %>% select(id, condition, rolnum)\n\nfin <- final %>% inner_join(ex22, by = \"id\")\n\nThen we group by Gender and summarise by mean. This allows us to see the mean score that each gender got correct. As we can see, females reported a higher correct score than males on average.\n\nfin %>% group_by(Gender) %>% summarise(mean(summm))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Gender `mean(summm)`\n  <chr>          <dbl>\n1 Female          4.75\n2 Male            3.68\n\n# mutate(rrr, coun)\n# fin %>% group_by(condition) %>% summarise(mean(summm))\n\nAnalyzing the data regarding the draw number we use the tii dataset. The reason is because this dataset was created in question 1 with a function named seperate. This function separated the column ‘draw’ into two others (rolsep, rolsum). The first stands for the title of the draw column while the second one stands for the values that a correct answer was reported.\nTherefore, we here use the filter column(rolnum) equal with the number of observation we want piped with summary(answer). This helps us find the stats behind the correct answers in each round. Also, we named a new dataset ‘i’ where it excludes some irrelevant columns for the purpose of analyzing the data based on draws.\nRegarding the draws we can see that the mean for outcome number 1 is almost 20% (0.1955). That means that one out of five people reported a correct answer in that case. As we can see the mean of correct responses ranges from 0.16 to 0.27. This means that the standard deviation is relatively low. In other words all correct response rates are clustered around the mean.\n\ni <- tii %>% select(-Gender, -Age, -SC0, -id, -Risk, -rolsep, -summm, -id)\n\nAdding missing grouping variables: `id`\n\ni

fin dataset, and then use summarise to find the mean. Alongside, as we set above, each number corresponds in one condition. As we can see, the most popular experimental condition is normative positive message (2) while the least popular is empirical positive message (5).\n\nfin %>% group_by(condition) %>% summarise(mean(summm))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  condition `mean(summm)`\n      <dbl>         <dbl>\n1         1          5.52\n2         2          6.08\n3         3          4.20\n4         4          3.64\n5         5          3.36\n\n\nRedo part 2 after excluding outliers. Do you still see the different in the experimental groups after outliers are eliminated? Do you see differences between the first and the last rolls? Are there any differences by gender?\n\n# trial <- fin %>% select(-Gender, -Age, -SC0, -Risk, -Outcome1, -Outcome2, -Outcome3, -Outcome4, -Outcome5, -Outcome6, -Outcome7, -Outcome8, -Outcome9, -Outcome10, -Outcome11, -Outcome12, -Outcome13, -Outcome14, -Outcome15, -Outcome16, -Outcome17, -Outcome18, -Outcome19, -Outcome20, -rolnum) %>% \n#   boxplot(trial)\n# \n# boxplot.stats(trial$summm)$out \n\n\nboxplot(fin$summm,\n  ylab = \"summm\")\n\n\n\nboxplot.stats(fin$summm)$out\n\n[1] 10 17 20 11 13 10 11 13\n\nout <- boxplot.stats(fin$summm)$out\nout_ind <- which(fin$summm %in% c(out))\nout_ind\n\n[1]  15  25  48  57  89  98 121 130\n\n# ggplot(fin) +\n#   aes(x = summm) +\n#   geom_histogram(bins = 21, fill = \"#0c4c8a\") +\n#   theme_minimal()\n\nAfter, wecreate a new dataset called ‘desperate’ where we remove the indicative rows with the outliers. This will help us redo exercise 2\n\ndesperate <- fin[-c(15, 25,48,57,89,98,121,130), ]\n\nRedoing exercise 2 with the new dataframe ‘desperate’.\nIn comparison with exercise 2, we can see that the mean for both male and female has fallen. This was a natural outcome to follow since the outliers were all above the mean. However, the outcome remained the same in matters of which gender reported the most correct answers. On average females report 4 correct answers out of twenty, as opposed to men (3/20).\n\ndesperate %>% group_by(Gender) %>% summarise(mean(summm))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  Gender `mean(summm)`\n  <chr>          <dbl>\n1 Female          4.19\n2 Male            3.14\n\n\nFor the draws, we are creating a new column to make the analysis named ‘abcdefg’. This is to exclude the outlier rows from the the ‘tii’ dataset we’ve used at exercise 2. After doing that though, we can see that the mean correct response reporting ratio remained at the same levels ranging from 16.54% to 27.07%. This indicates that the outliers did not affect the variability of the data. No difference between the first and last rows.\n\nabcdefg <- tii[-c(15, 25,48,57,89,98,121,130), ]\n\ni <- abcdefg %>% select(-Gender, -Age, -SC0, -id, -Risk, -summm, -rolsep, -id)\n\nAdding missing

The range between them became smaller (3.36 to 4.69). In other words the data became more disperse. While there is no difference in the lower end, there is a difference in the higher end of the range. This indicates that the previous means were inflated due to the high outliers. For insance, the most popular experimental condition, normative positive message (2), was 6.08, whereas now is just 4.33.\n\ndesperate %>% group_by(condition) %>% summarise(mean(summm))\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  condition `mean(summm)`\n      <dbl>         <dbl>\n1         1          4.70\n2         2          4.33\n3         3          3.74\n4         4          3.43\n5         5          3.36\n\n\nSplit your sample into the \"younger\" half and the \"older half.

As we can see, while the Age column now indicates only the oldest people, the majority is still under 30 – closer to the median. From the age 24 until 30s, the amount of correct responses seems to decline. We use the median and the mean code in order to see if there is a difference with them. Median indicates that there is no difference among the data as the reported correct outcome. However, if we look at the mean of the two, the younger group tends to report more correct answers on average than the older group.

This implies that there is an observed higher score of 0.015 with people that are older. Put differerently, the age factor has a negligible result to the score as is almost zero.\nb) How strong is the predictive power of age?\nLooking at the multiple R square we can see that the effect of age has almost zero explanation for the variability of the score. In other words, the predictive power of age on the time of victories is very weak.\nc) What's the predicted outcome for a 20 year old person?

With respect to Gender, now is also higher ton the other end than its corresponding previous result (-1.10 as opposed to -1.07).\nConsequently, there is a very slight inter correlation between the two factors as the model tends to become slightly stronger. How ever the differences are minimal. This is indicated also in the adjusted R squared (=0.016) which is even lower than R squared. This means that at least one of the two variables does not explain the dependent variable score. As we can see from the exercises 1 and 2, this variable is Age because its adjusted R squared is negative when we have Age as the only independent variable (see exercise 2).\nThen we proceed to an interaction coefficient just to observe the cross sections between our independent variables. Despite that the numbers are changing a bit though interaction coefficient is not necessary for the purpose of this exercise.\n\ncool3 <- lm(score~ Age * factor(Gendering), data = datacool1)\nsummary(cool3)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = score ~ Age * factor(Gendering), data = datacool1)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.8912 -1.6606 -0.6606  0.6527 15.5740 \n\nCoefficients:\n                       Estimate Std.

And in conclusion, this one does not have a strong predictive power.\nc) What is the predicted outcome for a 20 year old man? 20 year old woman? 40 year old man? 40 year old woman?\nFollowing similar procedure as the exercise 1 and 2 c, we substitute the age and gender factors in the equation for the equivalent results we need in the four different instances:\n\n#for 20year old man\ntwentyman <- 0.02*20-1.1*1+4.08\n\n#for 20year old woman\ntwentywoman <- 0.02*20-1.1*0+4.08\n\n#for 40year old man\nfourtyman <- 0.02*40-1.1*1+4.08\n\n#for 40year old woman\nfourtywoman <- 0.02*40-1.1*0+4.08\n\nAs we can see, the predicted scores are the following:\nfor 20year old man = 3.38\nfor 20year old woman = 4.48\nfor 40year old man = 3.78\nfor 40year old woman = 4.88"

Make sure to add a descriptive title, label the axes, and modify the look of the graph to be presentable. You can choose your own colors or use one of the palettes we talked about in class. Add a one-sentence explanation for the geometry you selected for the graph.\n\nworld_tidy %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = score, color = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Popularity\",\n       title = \"World Popularity of the main American cartoon sitcoms - Google Trends data\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(labels = c(\"Family Guy\", \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\")) #rename titles\n\n\n\n\nThe same code as before is used to make the graph. The only change here is that we rename the names of the shows in the graph by using the command “scale_color_discrete(labels = c(…)”.\n\n\nworld_tidy %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = score, color = name)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Popularity\",\n       title = \"Popularity graph\",\n       subtitle = \"Top 3 American sitcoms\"\n       ) +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Shows:\",\n                       labels = c(\"South Park\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Family Guy\")) +\n  theme_wsj()  #this theme makes the graph more presentable\n\n\n\n\nThis is a more presentable version of the graph above.\n\nSmooth the data (using a graph) to eliminate random noise.

LOESS (aka locally weighted smoothing), helps us see the relationship between the three variables and foresee trends. A LOESS smoother takes the data, fits a regression with the subset of data, and uses that linear regression model to get a point for the smoothed curve. The points closer to the fitted line are more impact-full.\n\nCreate a chart to show seasonality by month in your data. What does the chart tell you about the seasonality of your chosen search terms?

You can override using the `.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the Simpsons seasonality graph looks the same.

As we can see, From Hoover (1929) until Nixon (1974) issues and words related to “freedom”, and “peace” were emphasized. This makes sense since during that time, WW2 and the Vietnam War were fought.\n“Economy” seems like a topic that is popular in almost every presidency.\nDuring Ford’s and Reagan’s presidency, “tax”, and “growth” became really hot buzz words. Especially during Reagan administration, big tax reforms were introduced which they have significantly reduce taxes for businesses.\n“inflation” and “energy” were also popular during Nixon, Ford, and Reagan. It is important because especially during Nixon, the US economy after 14 years of economic development got in a stagflationary state; oil and gas crisis at the 70s was also a part of that.\nDuring George W Bush (2005), “security” was the most popular word used. This is because especially after 911, security became the main focus of his presidency.\nHealthcare gained importance during the Clinton Administration, and two administrations later, the Obama Administration expanded Medicaid. With the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare again dominated the policy priorities in Biden’s 2022 address.\nAll the presidents, irrespective of their political affiliation (Democrats vs Republicans), mentioned about strengthening / growing the economy. Only presidents affiliated with the Democratic party seemed to emphasize on “healthcare”, whereas a common theme among the Republican presidents’ addresses was “war / military spending / terrorism”.\nTop ten words of all Democrat Presidents\n\n#Previous speech links were not scraped so we import the excel that includes them here for the analysis\ndemocrat_speeches = pd.read_excel('democrat_speeches.xlsx')\n\n#I use a function and include the code that want to apply for every president.\ndef my_function(x):\n    r = requests.get(x['html'])\n    r.encoding = 'utf-8' \n    html = r.text \n    #print(html[0:2000]) \n\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, \"html.parser\")\n    president_text = soup.get_text()\n    #print(president_text[0:2000])\n\n    #THE DOCUMENT IS TOKENIZED -- SPLITTING TEXT INTO INDIVUDUAL WORDS\n    tokenizer = nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer('\\w+')\n    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(president_text) \n    #print(tokens[0:10])\n\n    #Defining stopwords and adding more to the list.

As we can see, George Washington, John Adams and James Madison are the least similar to Biden. This can be explained by the different eras that each president lived. Speeches in 18th century are different than speeches of today. Biden’s speech similarity with Obama and Clinton makes sense also because they are all recently elected democrats.\n\nBonus points: (5 points): Develop and algorithm that can allow you to determine if the speech was given by a Democrat or by a republican.\n\nPS2: I will go over this homework on Thursday to help you think through how to solve it.

    "text": "Here is my up-to-date Resume\nI am currently pursuing a Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in December 2022. Through my graduate coursework I am doing concentration in consumer analytics.\nAt UPenn, I am taking a challenging coursework including ‘Statistical Reasoning for Behavioral Science’, ‘Data Science and Quantitative Modeling’, ‘Judgments and Decisions’, ‘Public policy and Public Finance’. I was also elected as a student representative for GAPSA (Graduate and Professional Student Assembly) where I advocated for graduate student needs, and helped to organize activities that enhance the ties of the school’s graduate community.\nMy passion lies at the intersection of consumer behavior, marketing, technology, and data analysis. I believe behavioral science can inform marketing decisions to improve the consumer experience, satisfaction, and welfare. In my experience at previous positions, I developed analytical and problem-solving skills, an understanding of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, as well as strong interpersonal skills. While in school, I’ve worked for non-governmental organizations and represented Cyprus in educational programs in Europe and the US.\nI am always seeking new ways to improve marketing and consumer relations using behavioral science and analytics. During school, I’ve gained experience in Python, R, MS office, and SPSS. Looking forward to pursuing my interests and gaining experience in the field of consumer experience and market research."
