It is designed specifically for them and it works like Google maps. Great navigation tool while you are in Denmark. There will be machines (also a person for support) at the airport where you can buy tickets. Also, Denmark is infamous for cycling with great infrastructure. You can rent bikes as well and ride across the city."

    "text": "COOL VISITS\nNyhavn (The most iconic part of Copenhagen. Highly recommended. the Closest metro station: Kongens Nytorv station.)\n\n\n\nNyhavn\n\n\n\nSomething you can do is to walk through the shopping center of Copenhagen. You can go to Norreport station and walk towards Nyhavn. It is like a 1 to 1.5 mile (1.6–2.4km) walk. There are many stores and restaurants in between (along the yellow line on the map). While it is not a straightforward walk it is a pleasant one as you are passing through the shopping area of the city.\n\n\nRosenborg Castle & Botanical Garden (Nice places to walk around. Also, Rosenborg castle is a historic place that now operates as a museum ticket info. Have no opinion for the museum though as I haven’t been. Closest metro station: Norreport station)\nLittle Mermaid (You will often see it in souvenir shops as it is considered as one of the main attraction points in Copenhagen along Nyhavn. While you might not be impressed by it due to its tiny size, you may want to see it simply for its touristic outreach.) Osterport Station.\nAmalienborg (The equivalent ‘Buckingham palace’ of Denmark. Cool for walking around and taking pictures with the royal guards. Have no opinion for the museum there though as I haven’t been. tick info)\nCarlsberg Factory (if you like beer this is a nice place to visit. There is a tour in the factory and some beer tasting in the end. Carlsberg Station.)\nTivoli Gardens/Park (Located in front of the Central Station. The most famous park in Copenhagen. Kobenhavn H station)\nFisketorvet (If you like Malls, this can be an option. Most famous mall in the city.)\nBlack Diamond (The largest library in Denmark. It is a modern building. A Nice place to visit. Christianshavn station.)"

It is a renowned marijuana place since Christiania is the only part of Copenhagen where Danish law is not enforced. However, it is a safe area that is worth a visit mainly due to its particularity. Highly recommended.) Metro station: Christianshavn.\nBeautiful Parks (especially for summer walks):\n\n\nFrederiksberg Have (One of the most beautiful parks in Copenhagen) Frederiksberg station.\nSuperkilen Park (Norrebro station). Fun fact, Norrebro is an area where many immigrants stay. Diverse area.\nVestre Kirkegard (near Carlsberg factory) Metro: Carlsberg Station\n\nFOOD & COOL PLACES (min $ /max $$$$)\n\nUnion Kitchen $$ (Cool place for brunch. Heard great things from friends that have been there.)\nSticks’n’Sushi $$$ (Great sushi place. Known rooftop restaurant in the city.)\nDalle Valle $ (variety food buffet - alue for money place with plenty of food) Not fast food, but not a high-class restaurant. Almost always lots of people, decent food, a variety of options. Recommended for lunch.\nConditori La Glace $$$ (Traditional Danish pastries, it is the oldest patisserie in Denmark - founded in 1870, good for dessert)\nEspresso House $$ (coffee place, despite its Swedish origin it is considered as the ‘Starbucks’ of Denmark)\nBastard cafe $$ (a place full of board games. A nice place to go with friends for coffee/snacks/beer and board games.\nTaphouse $$ (Famous bar in the city. If you like beer then this is the place for you. It has one of the largest beer selections in Europe.)\n\nYou can always map your choices and combine visits that are close to each other. Also, since it is Scandinavia, remember to check the weather while preparing your bags! You are visiting arguably the most beautiful city in Scandinavia so try to enjoy every minute of it!\nHave fun and safe travels!"

As we can see, From Hoover (1929) until Nixon (1974) issues and words related to “freedom”, and “peace” were emphasized. This makes sense since during that time, WW2 and the Vietnam War were fought.\n“Economy” seems like a topic that is popular in almost every presidency.\nDuring Ford’s and Reagan’s presidency, “tax”, and “growth” became really hot buzz words. Especially during Reagan administration, big tax reforms were introduced which they have significantly reduce taxes for businesses.\n“inflation” and “energy” were also popular during Nixon, Ford, and Reagan. It is important because especially during Nixon, the US economy after 14 years of economic development got in a stagflationary state; oil and gas crisis at the 70s was also a part of that.\nDuring George W Bush (2005), “security” was the most popular word used. This is because especially after 911, security became the main focus of his presidency.\nHealthcare gained importance during the Clinton Administration, and two administrations later, the Obama Administration expanded Medicaid.

As we can see, George Washington, John Adams and James Madison are the least similar to Biden. This can be explained by the different eras that each president lived. Speeches in 18th century are different than speeches of today. Biden’s speech similarity with Obama and Clinton makes sense also because they are all recently elected democrats.\n\nBonus points: (5 points): Develop and algorithm that can allow you to determine if the speech was given by a Democrat or by a republican.\n\nPS2: I will go over this homework on Thursday to help you think through how to solve it.

    "text": "Here is my up-to-date Resume\nI am currently pursuing a Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences from the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in December 2022. Through my graduate coursework I am doing concentration in consumer analytics.\nAt UPenn, I am taking a challenging coursework including ‘Statistical Reasoning for Behavioral Science’, ‘Data Science and Quantitative Modeling’, ‘Judgments and Decisions’, ‘Public policy and Public Finance’. I was also elected as a student representative for GAPSA (Graduate and Professional Student Assembly) where I advocated for graduate student needs, and helped to organize activities that enhance the ties of the school’s graduate community.\nMy passion lies at the intersection of consumer behavior, marketing, technology, and data analysis. I believe behavioral science can inform marketing decisions to improve the consumer experience, satisfaction, and welfare. In my experience at previous positions, I developed analytical and problem-solving skills, an understanding of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, as well as strong interpersonal skills. While in school, I’ve worked for non-governmental organizations and represented Cyprus in educational programs in Europe and the US.\nI am always seeking new ways to improve marketing and consumer relations using behavioral science and analytics. During school, I’ve gained experience in Python, R, MS office, and SPSS. Looking forward to pursuing my interests and gaining experience in the field of consumer experience and market research."
