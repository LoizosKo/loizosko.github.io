<p>If you’re thinking of visiting Nepal, there are several things you need to know to make the most out of your trip. Nepal is a destination known for its natural beauty, cultural richness, and friendly people. Whether you’re seeking adventure or a peaceful escape, Nepal has something for everyone.</p>
<p>This article provides a valuable firsthand account of a traveler’s experiences in Nepal. Here you can find practical advice and tips on currency exchange, transportation, and sightseeing in Kathmandu and Pokhara, as well as recommendations on where to eat and what to do. The article also highlights the friendliness and safety of the Nepalese people, which is important information for anyone considering a trip to Nepal.</p>
<p>When planning your trip, there are two options to consider:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Traveling with a travel agency</p></li>
<li><p>Planning your trip alone</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Visiting Nepal with a travel agency can offer many advantages such as access to local knowledge and expertise, organized activities and transportation, and peace of mind. Especially if you are going for high-altitude hikes, a guide and a porter to carry your bags can be very helpful. On the other hand, planning a trip alone gives you more flexibility, freedom, and the opportunity to design a more personalized itinerary. I would recommend that option if your main plan is to explore Nepal’s culture and interact with locals. You save a lot and you have no one to deal with. Also, it is completely safe to make the trip to Nepal alone!</p>
<p>If you are going with a tourist agency, <a href="https://www.himalayanwonders.com/?selocation=US">Himalayan Wonders</a> is extremely organized that takes care of the whole trip for you. They answer fast when you email them. If you are price sensitive, they have a sister company, <a href="https://www.adventurehero.com/">Adventurehero</a>, which does the same trips but for cheaper prices — less fancy hotels and jeep rides instead of internal flights. When organizing your trip with an agency, it can also be stressful if you leave everything for the last moment so consider finalizing the booking some days in advance.</p>
<p>When I visited Nepal with a friend in February 2023, we went without a guide. While doing the proper research can be time-consuming, hopefully, this article saves you some time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tasks-before-visiting">TASKS BEFORE VISITING</h2>
<p>💉Health: Consult your doctor before going. Typically, there are suggested vaccines such as rabies, typhoid, hepatitis, and tetanus, but recommendations vary depending on each traveler. Malaria is uncommon there but also depends on the cities that you are going to. Usually, malaria cases are reported in the lower west side of Nepal e.g. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ilam+57300,+Nepal/@26.8984852,87.8876952,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x39e5c3933be14d23:0x90060622ff0776f8!8m2!3d26.9111769!4d87.9236747!16s%2Fm%2F026mh1d">Ilam</a>. It is recommended to have international health insurance that covers you before going. I got mine from Revolut by upgrading from free to premium paying $8.99/month. If you don’t have revolut, feel free to create an account through my <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/referral/?referral-code=loizosq28%21FEB1-23-AR">referral</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going for a big hike i.e.&nbsp;Everest base camp, it is recommended to get an insurance that covers evacuation with a helicopter, because if anything happens to you while in the mountain and you are uninsured, the bill you pay will be over <code>$</code>2500! I did not need it, but in case you do, here is the email of the guy that I asked for information from (this advice applies to you if you are from Cyprus); <em>giorgostheodorou4@gmail.com</em> ; He works at Metlife, and when I shared him a trip schedule that was including everest, he drafted me a <code>$</code>90 insurance.</p>
<p>🍣 Food: If you are considering going hiking, bring with you some protein bars that will keep you during the day. It is not certain that you will find proper restaurants in the mountain while hiking. The following comes from my doctor’s advice— In general, eat only well-cooked food to minimize the risk of food poisoning. When it comes to water, bottled drinks are your go-to. Avoid using ice cubes or drinking from glasses. When brushing your teeth use bottled water and when shower with your mouth closed.</p>
<p>🛂 Visa: You can do it when you arrive there at the airport (highly recommended) or <a href="https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/">apply for it</a> in advance. You will need two recent passport-size photos and a fee. There are three options: Visa for 15 days (<code>$</code>30), for 30 days (<code>$</code>50), and for 90 days (<code>$</code>125).</p>
<p>🥾 Hiking: In Nepal, you need a permit to go hiking called <a href="https://www.himalayastrek.com/information/trekkers-information-management-system-tims/">TIMS</a>, which you can do there. You will need two recent passport-size photos for this. In general, nature in Nepal can be dangerous and you can be lost if you try to do big hikes without taking someone experienced with you.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="currency-simcard">CURRENCY &amp; SIMCARD</h2>
<p><strong>Currency</strong>: Nepalese rupees. Do the conversion <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;ei=eCDlY7yBGMbUkwXJzoS4Ag&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8ndSV74j9AhVG6qQKHUknAScQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIKCAAQgAQQRhCCAjIJCAAQFhAeEPEEMgkIABAWEB4Q8QQyBggAEBYQHjIJCAAQFhAeEPEEMgYIABAWEB4yCQgAEBYQHhDxBDIJCAAQFhAeEPEEMgkIABAWEB4Q8QQyBQgAEIYDOgoIABBHENYEELADOgcIABCwAxBDOgUIABCABEoECEEYAEoECEYYAFCsBljQDGD0D2gCcAF4AIABywSIAbwKkgEHMy0xLjEuMZgBAKABAcgBCcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">here</a> before you buy something.</p>
<p>You can exchange your money at the airport (don’t do it before you pass the passport check), afterwards you find better rates. You also need a Sim card. You can get that also at the airport, after you arrive, the provider <a href="https://www.ncell.axiata.com/en">Ncell</a> will have a brunch near the exit/entrance of the airport and you can get a sim card from there. I got mine with 25GB internet data and it was around <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=600+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;ei=nCLlY6-MOormsAev0YyACg&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivyp2b8Yj9AhUKM-wKHa8oA6AQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=600+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIJCAAQgAQQDRAKMgsIABAIEB4QDRDxBDILCAAQCBAeEA0Q8QQyCwgAEAgQHhANEPEEMgsIABAIEB4QDRDxBDILCAAQCBAeEA0Q8QQyCAgAEAgQHhANMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDOgoIABBHENYEELADOgcIABCwAxBDSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUNUEWLsNYMAOaAFwAXgAgAGKAogBoQ6SAQMyLTiYAQCgAQHIAQrAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">600 Rupees</a>.</p>

<section id="day-1-arrival-in-kathmandu" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-1-arrival-in-kathmandu">DAY 1: Arrival in Kathmandu</h2>
<p>Arrived in Kathmandu at 6 pm in the evening, and met with my friend in the airport. It’s important to note that when it comes to transportation, you should avoid anyone that asks to give you a ride beside the taxis with green labels, which are the official ones.</p>
<p>We took a taxi (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1000+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;ei=mY3qY832GpmXxc8P2q-4wA0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiNp4r5m5P9AhWZS_EDHdoXDtgQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=1000+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwA0oECEEYAEoECEYYAFCKBljCCmD2C2gCcAF4AIABxAKIAYIHkgEFMi0yLjGYAQCgAQHIAQPAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">1000 rupees</a>) from the airport to our hotel (<a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/np/flock-hostel-kathmandu.en-gb.html?label=gen173rf-1BCAsoqwFCFmZsb2NrLWhvc3RlbC1rYXRobWFuZHVIM1gDaKcCiAEBmAEJuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEBiAIBogIKbWVkaXVtLmNvbagCA7gC9fC_oAbAAgHSAiRiZjBmMDZjNy03NjMzLTRlZDItYjIxZi00ZjQ5MmU0NTRmMzHYAgXgAgE&amp;sid=4acf5d0463d423e375c14608aa454ac4&amp;dist=0&amp;keep_landing=1&amp;sb_price_type=total&amp;type=total&amp;">Flock Hostel Kathmandu</a>) and we met there our potential trip guide. We were planning to go at Pokhara and stay there for a couple of nights, do some activities and some hikes around the area. The guide was not clear about his pricings during our negotiation and he asked us to pay for his expenses as well on top of his fee, so we decided to do the trip by ourselves.</p>
<p>At night we went out to get some dinner. We ended up at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Roadhouse+Cafe/@27.7161884,85.3004017,15.49z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sroadhouse+cafe+kathmandu!3m6!1s0x39eb18fcf090a315:0x4ecba2d034b5135b!8m2!3d27.7143996!4d85.3103329!15sChhyb2FkaG91c2UgY2FmZSBrYXRobWFuZHVaGiIYcm9hZGhvdXNlIGNhZmUga2F0aG1hbmR1kgEQcGl6emFfcmVzdGF1cmFudJoBI0NoWkRTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VRdGVtVlFiMDlSRUFF4AEA!16s%2Fg%2F1tjgm_wj">Roadhouse cafe</a> and we had some oven pizza. It was a central place with nice atmoshpere inside, mostly tourists were in it though. After we returned home. The city, despite the functionally chaotic driving (i.e.&nbsp;there are no traffic lights) and the fact that some people will try to sell you drugs, is safe; no robberies or violence. Honestly, when it comes to security and people, I felt safer than I feel in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><em>Roadhouse cafe seems to be a local chain as we found couple of them in Pokhara and Kathmandu.</em></p>

<p>Woke up early and went to our respective embassies; the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Embassy+of+France/@27.7045644,85.3196779,14.01z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x39eb191b9d54514d:0x7f4ebc8975141067!8m2!3d27.7200851!4d85.3194274!16s%2Fg%2F1234z3n3">French embassy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Honorary+Consulate+of+the+Republic+of+Cyprus/@27.7045644,85.3196779,14.01z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x39eb197bfb7e77d1:0xb53c334ba958624b!8m2!3d27.7109734!4d85.3145653!16s%2Fg%2F11j4hhg6vs">consulate of Cyprus</a>. French embassy asked from my friend to sign a document with his address in it; they did not allow us to enter. While the consulate of Cyprus was more accessible, there are no Cypriots working there. It is operated by locals, and they mostly issue tourist and student visas for Nepalese people that visit Cyprus.</p>
<p>Next destination, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gaia+Restro+%26+Coffee+Shop/@27.7132225,85.3106978,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x39eb18fd9a95c763:0x106bfc1dbd8cea66!8m2!3d27.7132225!4d85.3128918!16s%2Fg%2F1hc1s1f5v">Gaia Restro &amp; Coffee Shop</a> for breakfast. It is a relaxed place with open space to sit outside and nice food.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went to buy bus tickets for Pokhara, the place we were about to go the next day. We bought the tickets from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/27%C2%B042'54.5%22N+85%C2%B018'39.3%22E/@27.7151389,85.3109167,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d27.7151389!4d85.3109167">East and West International Tours and Travels Ltd</a> (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@27.7151149,85.3108937,3a,75y,20.01h,91.54t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipOlHbgbRWqvQ4s7VdRyhoke9a32x4bWKz1NcgtP!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOlHbgbRWqvQ4s7VdRyhoke9a32x4bWKz1NcgtP%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya53.29282-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352">front</a>).

Luxury bus is recommended since the road to Kathmandu is bumpy. Normally it takes around 7–8 hours the trip from Kathmandu to Pokhara. As long as you have your ticket, make sure to be at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tourist+Bus+Stop/@27.7107721,85.3089046,14.16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x39eb19022390cd3b:0x628cd4e65f9d0fba!8m2!3d27.7186097!4d85.3083489!16s%2Fg%2F11c1s0g237">tourist bus stop</a> early in the morning half an hour before your bus.</p>
<p>Then we started walking towards the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=monkey+temple&amp;ei=oyLlY5NijIGL6A_ImLywCA&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTv4-e8Yj9AhWMwAIHHUgMD4YQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=monkey+temple&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BQguEJECOgUIABCRAjoFCC4QgAQ6CwguEIAEEMcBENEDOgcILhDUAhBDOgsILhDHARDRAxCRAjoECAAQQzoLCC4QrwEQxwEQgAQ6CwguEIAEEMcBEK8BOgYIABAKEEM6BwgAEIAEEAo6CAguEIAEENQCSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUABYmRFg7xJoAHABeAGAAbIEiAHfGpIBCTItNS4xLjMuMZgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">Monkey Temple</a>. From there that we bought the tickets it was a 35-minute walk, however it was nice as we were able to stop along the way to shops and buy clothes and souvenirs.</p>
<p>The monkey temple is awesome because there is more trees, many monkeys, and a beautiful view of the city. The ticket to get in was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=200+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;ei=yzPlY-LpJ5CakgWkgonIAQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii-9jMgYn9AhUQjaQKHSRBAhkQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=200+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIJCAAQBxAeEPEEMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDMgUIABCGAzoKCAAQRxDWBBCwA0oECEEYAEoECEYYAFCyB1iRC2DNDWgCcAF4AIAB5AGIAZ0FkgEDMi0zmAEAoAEByAEEwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">200 Rupees</a> per person. Try not to feed the monkeys and keep your stuff on you cause they are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q1MyVUze8M">sneaky animals</a>! My advice; enjoy the view, take some pictures, and go continue exploring the city.</p>
<p>Next, on the way to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=durbar+square&amp;ei=fzPlY5eTM8X2kwW3o4WoDw&amp;oq=dhurbar+sq&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAxgAMggIABAWEB4QCjoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoECAAQQzoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgUIABCRAjoFCC4QgAQ6BAguEEM6BwgAEIAEEAo6BwguEIAEEAo6DQguEIAEEMcBEK8BEAo6BggAEB4QCjoICAAQHhAPEAo6BggAEB4QDzoLCAAQBRAeEPEEEAo6CAgAEAUQHhAKOgUIIRCgAUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWIMdYM8saABwAXgBgAHOBogBoh6SAQsyLTYuMC4yLjAuMpgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">Durbar Square</a>, we found a local football court, the one that is visible from the monkey temple, where many kids were playing football. It looked like they frequently play there. Playing football with the kids was for me the best experience of the day. Football is a universal sport that makes everyone forget life problems and enjoy the game and in that moment that was the definition we lived in.</p>
<p>Durbar Square was a positive surprise for us. There we found many restaurants, coffee shops, and there are no cars in that area so many people walk there. Nearby you can also find the temple of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=durbar+square&amp;ei=fzPlY5eTM8X2kwW3o4WoDw&amp;oq=dhurbar+sq&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAxgAMggIABAWEB4QCjoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoECAAQQzoLCC4QgAQQxwEQ0QM6BQgAEIAEOgUIABCRAjoFCC4QgAQ6BAguEEM6BwgAEIAEEAo6BwguEIAEEAo6DQguEIAEEMcBEK8BEAo6BggAEB4QCjoICAAQHhAPEAo6BggAEB4QDzoLCAAQBRAeEPEEEAo6CAgAEAUQHhAKOgUIIRCgAUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFAAWIMdYM8saABwAXgBgAHOBogBoh6SAQsyLTYuMC4yLjAuMpgBAKABAcABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">Kumari Ghar</a>.</p>
<p><em>Kumari Ghar is a historical place of worship for Hindus and Bhuddists.</em></p>
<p>Note that some people try to scam tourists and ask them to pay to go to the square.

<p>Since the bus was leaving at 7 am, you have to be at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tourist+Bus+Stop/@27.7107721,85.3089046,14.16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x39eb19022390cd3b:0x628cd4e65f9d0fba!8m2!3d27.7186097!4d85.3083489!16s%2Fg%2F11c1s0g237">Tourist bus station</a> half an hour earlier. The bus ride is bumpy but doable. The driver makes 3 stops until Pokhara. At the stops, there are restaurants and restrooms. We ate at one of the road restaurants just rice and noodles, since we are used to different diet we did not want to risk eating meat and uncooked vegetables.</p>
<p>We arrived at Pokhara at 5 pm, and then took a taxi (we also got the number of the driver for future rides) from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tourist+Bus+Park/@28.201115,83.9704186,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x399595086931689d:0xf26fc25b618f70b8!2sTourist+Bus+Park!8m2!3d28.2011103!4d83.9726073!16s%2Fg%2F1td_929t!3m5!1s0x399595086931689d:0xf26fc25b618f70b8!8m2!3d28.2011103!4d83.9726073!16s%2Fg%2F1td_929t">the tourist bus park</a> to our hotel, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Middle+Path+%26+Spa/@28.2110123,83.9573078,17z/data=!4m18!1m8!3m7!1s0x3995951dc419405b:0xcf221638ba298cf4!2sMiddle+Path+St,+Pokhara+33700,+Nepal!3b1!8m2!3d28.2110076!4d83.9594965!16s%2Fg%2F11bx26l3n7!3m8!1s0x3995951dc6cff135:0xf1cd87f548ab101d!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d28.2110147!4d83.9596463!16s%2Fg%2F1vbnmtgq">Hotel Middle Path and Spa</a>.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-4-sunrise-and-tibetan-refugee-camp">DAY 4: Sunrise and Tibetan Refugee Camp</h2>
<p>Our day started early. At 5.40 am, yesterday’s taxi driver picked us up from the hotel, and drove us to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sarangkot+View+Tower/@28.2343211,84.0024179,11.69z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x399594bc9701c979:0x1abee2e4f733a4be!8m2!3d28.2460666!4d83.9486371!16s%2Fg%2F11d_88881x">Sarangkot</a> to see the sunrise. The view from there was amazing. You could see all the big hikes of the area such as Dhaulagiri (8167m), Machhapuchhare (6993m) and, Annapurna II (8,091m), and a panoramic view of Pokhara. Then the driver took us back to the hotel where we slept for a while. After, we went for breakfast at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/White+Rabbit+Coffee/@28.2096141,83.9547407,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3995951ef3fe215f:0x316ee9634cc49838!8m2!3d28.2096094!4d83.9569294!16s%2Fg%2F11c0rm_w_n">White Rabbit cafe</a> nearby Pokhara’s lake. It was the best breakfast we had in Nepal so far! We also had a great lake view and we saw a football tournament going on next to the lake. So after our breakfast, we wanted to get closer to watch and play with them. The tournament seemed very well organized and was taken seriously by the participants. We found out that the prize for the winning team was <code>$</code>2000. We watched a very entertaining game with last-minute goals and a penalty shootout. Then, we borrowed a ball from the court and we played with the kids in the field. It was a beautiful experience.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we left to buy a return bus ticket from Pokhara to Kathmandu. We asked a local tourist agency which sold us the bus ticket for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1600+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;ei=FePnY-XvO8-GgQaEx4f4CQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwilzriGkY79AhVPQ8AKHYTjAZ8Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=1600+nepalese+rupees+to+usd&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgUIABCiBDIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEOgoIABBHENYEELADSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUMsHWMEMYKMOaAFwAXgAgAGDAogBgwKSAQMyLTGYAQCgAQHIAQTAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">1600 rupees</a>. My friend was asking to rent a motorcycle for the next week. He negotiated with the guy there and he promised him a fee if he was going to help him find a good motorcycle at a good price. Finally, he got an offer to rent it for <code>$</code>35/day. We left satisfied from there.</p>
<p><em>If you’re planning on renting a motorcycle in Nepal, there are a few important tips to keep in mind according to my friend. First, make sure to choose a trustworthy rental company and inspect the motorcycle carefully before renting it. You can do that by negotiating with multiple rental places. When it comes to places to go, Lower Mustang is a great option with recommended stops in Kalopani, Jomson, Kagbeni, and Muktinath, each for a day. Upper Mustang is another great option with a recommended 4-day trip from Kagbeni to the Tibetan border, including a night in Ghami and the other nights in the forbidden kingdom of Lo. Remember that you will need to obtain a permit to enter these regions, which costs 500€. While it’s possible to complete this itinerary in 7 days, it’s recommended to allow for a total of 10 days to enjoy the trip at a more relaxing pace.</em></p>
<p>In the afternoon, we took a taxi for <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tibetan+Refugee+Camp+Pokhara/@28.1766224,83.9794185,13.24z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3995956b19944761:0x1de39cca0ad80f1a!8m2!3d28.1879939!4d83.9565757!16s%2Fg%2F11ggs7n0n3">Tibetan Refugee Camp</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Tibetan Refugee Camp in Pokhara, Nepal, is home to thousands of Tibetan refugees who fled from their homeland in Tibet due to political and religious persecution by the Chinese government. After the Chinese takeover of Tibet in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama and many Tibetans fled to India and Nepal, where they established a number of refugee settlements, including the camp in Pokhara. The camp in Pokhara was established in the 1960s and has since then provided a home and a sense of community for Tibetan refugees. The camp is run by the Tibetan Refugee Welfare Office and provides basic facilities, such as housing, schools, medical clinics, and workshops, to its residents.</em></p>
<p>Despite the challenges Tibetan refugees face, such as limited resources and difficult living conditions, the Tibetan refugees in Pokhara have maintained their rich cultural heritage and traditions. They have established monasteries, schools, and community centers, where they can practice their religion, preserve their language, and pass their traditions down to future generations.</p>

<p>Last day in Pokhara started with a late wake-up. We had breakfast with Todd and Ruth and then went shopping at Pokhara’s main street. There are many quality products such as cashmere clothing, and brands such as NorthFace, Colombia, Patagonia that you can find much cheaper than Europe and America. On top of that negotiating is expected so you can get an even better price. After negotiating I got the following deals: a NorthFace jacket from 8500 initial price to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=7000+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=4mLsY_boMNGExc8P0fSpgA8&amp;iflsig=AK50M_UAAAAAY-xw8pH-vJejz91Zm_C1QFUG6Uvhd9qG&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj24YS_25b9AhVRQvEDHVF6CvAQ4dUDCAg&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=7000+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCQgAEBYQHhDxBDIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDMgUIABCGAzIFCAAQhgM6CwguEIAEEMcBENEDOgUILhCABDoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCABBBGEIICOgwIABCABBANEEYQggI6BwgAEIAEEA06BQghEKABOgcIIRCgARAKUABY-YYBYKiJAWgGcAB4AIAByAKIAZJckgEHMi0xNS4yNJgBAKABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">7000 rupees</a>, a NorthFace sweatpants from 2500 to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1800+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;ei=9WLsY4vlPMeSxc8Pv8Gm4Ac&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLs5jI25b9AhVHSfEDHb-gCXwQ4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=1800+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICCEQoAEQwwQ6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6BQgAEKIESgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUJkGWJkiYIMnaAFwAXgAgAHKAogB_QmSAQUyLTEuM5gBAKABAcgBB8ABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">1800 rupees</a>, gloves for snow from 1000 to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=900+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;ei=FmPsY4Uwlr3Fzw-M4YrwBA&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFk7rX25b9AhWWXvEDHYywAk4Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=900+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgUIABCiBDIFCAAQogQ6CggAEEcQ1gQQsANKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQlQZY4Adg4AtoAnABeACAAbYCiAGdB5IBAzMtM5gBAKABAcgBBMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">900 rupees</a>, and a cashmere sweater from 8500 to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=5000+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;ei=UmPsY5-lG8eFxc8PrKO26AI&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiflqP025b9AhXHQvEDHayRDS0Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=5000+nepalese+rupee+to+dollar&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzIKCAAQRxDWBBCwA0oECEEYAEoECEYYAFDyBlj5CWDbC2gCcAF4AIABvgKIAZ8HkgEDMy0zmAEAoAEByAEEwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">5000 rupees</a>.</p>
<p>Then we had lunch at the restaurant <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fresh+Elements+Restaurant+%26+Bar/@28.2113951,83.9560655,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3995951e75301097:0x440c372df9db7af2!8m2!3d28.2113951!4d83.9582595!16s%2Fg%2F11d_w813t5">Fresh Elements</a>. Very good restaruant with a lot of options and good prices; only downside is that their portions are relatively small. Our hotel <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hotel+Middle+Path+%26+Spa/@28.2111682,83.9574709,17z/data=!4m17!1m7!3m6!1s0x3995951e75301097:0x440c372df9db7af2!2sFresh+Elements+Restaurant+%26+Bar!8m2!3d28.2113951!4d83.9582595!16s%2Fg%2F11d_w813t5!3m8!1s0x3995951dc6cff135:0xf1cd87f548ab101d!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d28.2110147!4d83.9596463!16s%2Fg%2F1vbnmtgq">Middle Path &amp; Spa</a>, is collaborating with that restaurant so everything we were ordering from our hotel was coming from there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my friend rented a motorcycle for <code>$</code>35/day from Pokhara with a plan to go to a 5-day ride starting from Pokhara to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jomsom,+Nepal/@28.8561979,83.4445969,9.97z/data=!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x39be6c7eb19f2ab7:0x2c40a8c5a03d3c04!2sMustang,+Nepal!3b1!8m2!3d28.9985065!4d83.8473015!16zL20vMDhjbHNi!3m5!1s0x39be0e42b3323685:0xb78689d6f4ff1019!8m2!3d28.7746477!4d83.7730237!16s%2Fm%2F03cpg01">Jomsom</a>, and ending to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Upper+Mustang,+Nepal/@29.234739,83.2930096,9z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1supper+mustang!3m6!1s0x39be61bdb2301d83:0xd2d8fef01389732d!8m2!3d29.234739!4d83.9257357!15sCg11cHBlciBtdXN0YW5nWg8iDXVwcGVyIG11c3RhbmeSARJ0b3VyaXN0X2F0dHJhY3Rpb26aASNDaFpEU1VoTk1HOW5TMFZKUTBGblNVTXllVXgyY1ZSQkVBReABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11j0233dk1">Upper Mustang</a>. To ride at Upper Mustang, you need to pay for a permit <code>$</code>500, and have two more people with you for security. However, the pictures suggest that it is a worthwhile experience! In the evening I took the overnight bus at 7.30 pm for Kathmandu.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="day-8-departure-from-nepal">DAY 8: Departure from Nepal</h2>
<p>Last day in Nepal started early in Kathmandu. I arrived at 5 am. That time everything was closed. So I took a taxi for the reception of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kathmandu+Guest+House/@27.7151892,85.2994928,14z/data=!4m9!3m8!1s0x39eb18fc95267159:0xd33fc3adabcb9768!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d27.7151892!4d85.3094953!16s%2Fg%2F11gghdw_5l">Kathmandu Guest House hotel</a>. There is security, resting chairs to sleep in, and good breakfast. I left my luggage there, and I walked towards Durbar square. They asked me for a ticket once more (apparently if you don’t look local they ask you to pay 150 rupees). Don’t pay for this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Himalayan+Java+Coffee-+Basantapur/@27.703594,85.2912077,15z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1shimalayan+java!3m6!1s0x39eb18561306a4f7:0x4ce88fe9a66bfcff!8m2!3d27.7035952!4d85.3076876!15sCg5oaW1hbGF5YW4gamF2YSIDiAEBWhAiDmhpbWFsYXlhbiBqYXZhkgELY29mZmVlX3Nob3DgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F12hsqsdg3">Himalayan Java</a> is the main coffee chain in Nepal. There is one in the middle of Durbar square so I went for pancakes. It seems fancier than the average coffee shop. It is the ‘Starbucks’ of Nepal.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went back to the Guest House hotel to pick up my luggage and called the morning taxi driver to take me to the airport (we agreed in the morning <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=800+nepalese+rupees+to+dollar&amp;source=hp&amp;ei=MXvsY4KACo6Nxc8Pz7G42AE&amp;iflsig=AK50M_UAAAAAY-yJQXIu9FaPVSsHhYNEiBNneXYBkOg4&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC3IvW8pb9AhWORvEDHc8YDhsQ4dUDCAg&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=800+nepalese+rupees+to+dollar&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCQgAEBYQHhDxBDIFCAAQhgMyBQgAEIYDMgUIABCGAzoFCC4QgAQ6BQgAEIAEOgoIABCABBBGEIICOgYIABAWEB46CwgAEBYQHhAPEPEEOggIABAWEB4QDzoLCAAQFhAeEPEEEAo6BQghEKABOgQIIRAVOgsIIRAWEB4Q8QQQHVAAWNxgYLVhaAZwAHgAgAGnAogB6keSAQQyLTM0mAEAoAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">800 rupees</a> for the airport ride).</p>
<p>Overall, Nepal is among the best trips I have ever made and I’d love to revisit to see more nature and different cities. I hope you find this article useful for your trip planning to Nepal or satisfactory for your curiosity about the country and its culture.</p>
