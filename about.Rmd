**Study of the US Institutes for Student leaders (SUSI)**

In 2019 I was selected to represent Europe in 5-week, fully funded, highly competitive program for young leaders. The program included coursework, company visits, and travel, examining entrepreneurial approaches and economic development in USA.

**Living in Philadelphia**

My arrival at University of Pennsylvania was a new chapter in my academic and social life. I am grateful for all the people I met here in Philadelphia; especially for my professors, classmates, and housemates that help me to become better day-by-day.
