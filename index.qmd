This is my personal website. Here you can find information about me.

I am **currently pursuing** a **Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences** from the **University of Pennsylvania**, **graduating in December 2022**. Through my graduate coursework I am doing concentration in data science.

At UPenn, I took a challenging coursework including 'Statistical Reasoning for Behavioral Science', 'Data Science and Quantitative Modeling', 'Judgments and Decisions', 'Public policy and Public Finance'. I am also elected as a **student representative** for [GAPSA](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/lps-gov/program-representatives/) (Graduate and Professional Student Assembly) where I organize activities that enhance the ties among the school's graduate community. Moreover, I have gained invaluable experience working as a **project analyst** for DiagnosePoint start-up (launches an at-home PCR testing product targeting businesses), where I conducted market research on their behalf. I have conducted desk research and interviewed companies to gather information, where I identified and presented areas for potential improvement.

During spring semester 2022, I am taking 'Data Science and Quantitative modelling', 'Behavioral Public Policy', and 'Norms and Nudges'. In addition, I am doing my capstone project where I will be working in a team setting for a company to solve business questions/problems. It will be an 9-week process from February until May.

**During my bachelor degree,** I have gained multifaceted exposure to different sectors**.** I have worked in tourist industry, financial industry, and academia. I volunteered at [Erasmus Student Network Nicosia](https://www.facebook.com/esnnicosia) where I organized trips, game nights, and activities in Cyprus for international students. There I was elected as the National Exchangeability Coordinator for Cyprus (year 2018-2019) where I was responsible for ensuring that all the events/activities that are happening from ESN, were inclusive. Alongside, in collaboration with the Social Inclusion Coordinator, we have organized 2-week social inclusion days where we visited special schools, organized sign-language workshops, movie nights, and participated at Red-Cross blood donation events and HIV campaigns in Cyprus.

I have also actively participated in **policy-making** processes. I was a member of [Youth Parliament of Cyprus](https://www.facebook.com/voulineon) for three years where we managed to pass bills that digitalize Cyprus education and actively advocate for them to the decision making centers. Moreover, as a member of [UNYSA Cyprus](https://www.facebook.com/UNYSACYPRUS/) (United Nation Youth Student Association) , I represented my country at Harvard Model United Nations. Furthermore, I raised \$700 and helped the board to organize a 5-week internship for Public Policy making for two Cypriots in the US Congress and the American Hellenic institute in Washington DC.
