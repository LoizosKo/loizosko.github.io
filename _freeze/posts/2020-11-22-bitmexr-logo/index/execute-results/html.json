For one reason or another I never quite got round to it, but that changes today! I thought I'd note down the steps I took here for future reference.\n\nA quick google of \"how to create R hex logo\" pointed me towards the `hexSticker` package, which I promptly installed and set to work. After having a look at some of the examples on https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker, I opted for a really simple design (I was never much of an artist ðŸ˜†) using the following code:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(hexSticker)\n\nsticker(\"/home/harry/Desktop/Bitcoin-Logo.png\",\n        package=\"bitmexr\",\n        p_size=20,\n        s_x=1,\n        s_y=0.75,\n        s_width = 0.9,\n        s_height = 0.9,\n        h_fill = \"#000000\",\n        h_color = \"#f2a900\",\n        asp = 0.9,\n        filename=\"hex.png\")\n```\n:::\n\nThe end result looks like this\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"hex.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hex.png){fig-align='center' width=259}\n:::\n:::\n\nNot particularly imaginative, but I'm happy with it as a first attempt! \n",
