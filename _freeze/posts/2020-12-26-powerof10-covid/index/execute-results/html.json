In this post, I wanted to investigate how Covid has impacted track performances in the UK compared to previous seasons. Specifically, I was interested in how the distribution of performances may differ between this season and previous seasons. I also wondered if there may be some differences between the elite athletes who may have had additional opportunities to compete this year (national championships, diamond leagues etc) compared to non-elite athletes, who may have faced the most significant reductions in competitive opportunities. \n\n### The data\n\nI used my [poweRof10](https://powerof10.hfshr.xyz/) package to collect data from www.thepowerof10.info. Specifically, I gathered the rankings for each season from 2016 to 2020 for both men and women for the following events; 100, 200, 400, 800, 1500 and 5000. If interested, you can see the code I used to collect and prepare the data by expanding the code label below.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE)\nlibrary(poweRof10)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(furrr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(hms)\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(see)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(extrafont)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n# function from https://fishandwhistle.net/post/2018/modifying-facet-scales-in-ggplot2/ for tweaking facets\nscale_override <- function(which, scale) {\n  if(!is.numeric(which) || (length(which) != 1) || (which %% 1 != 0)) {\n    stop(\"which must be an integer of length 1\")\n  }\n  \n  if(is.null(scale$aesthetics) || !any(c(\"x\", \"y\") %in% scale$aesthetics)) {\n    stop(\"scale must be an x or y position scale\")\n  }\n  \n  structure(list(which = which, scale = scale), class = \"scale_override\")\n}\n\nCustomFacetWrap <- ggproto(\n  \"CustomFacetWrap\", FacetWrap,\n  init_scales = function(self, layout, x_scale = NULL, y_scale = NULL, params) {\n    #

I've coloured the average performance in <span style = 'color:#0072B2;'>this colour</span> and highlighted 2020 performances in <span style = 'color:#D55E00'>this colour</span>. I have also split the rankings into two groups; \"Elite\", defined as the top 10 athletes and \"Sub elite\", defined as those athletes occupying ranks 11-100. \n\nThe y axis on the figure is the [kernel density estimate](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html), which is a smoothed version of the histogram. For these plots, I've removed the y axis label as I wanted the focus to be on the _shape_ of the density estimate and position relative the the x-axis (performance) for the two groups (average of previous years vs this year), rather than the actual density estimate as I think comparing the shape and position of the curves tells the better story.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrank_plots <- clean_rankings %>% \n  mutate(input_year = fct_rev(input_year),\n         covid_year = ifelse(input_year == \"2020\", \"covid\", \"pre_covid\")) %>% \n  select(input_year, time, rank, event, gender, covid_year) %>% \n  group_by(gender, event, input_year) %>% \n  mutate(rank_group = case_when(rank %in% c(1:10) ~ \"top_10\",\n                                rank %in% c(11:100) ~ \"11_to_100\",\n                                rank %in% c(101:max(rank)) ~ \"101_to_max\"),\n         rank_group = factor(rank_group, levels = c(\"top_10\", \"11_to_100\", \"101_to_max\"))) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  group_by(event, gender, covid_year, rank, rank_group) %>% \n  mutate(Performance = as_datetime(mean(as.POSIXct(time)))) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(event = paste(event, \"m\"),\n         event = factor(event, levels = c(\"100 m\", \"200 m\", \"400 m\", \"800 m\", \"1500 m\", \"5000 m\")),\n         lab = \"wow\")\n```\n:::\n  \n### Elite performances\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:elite-performances) shows the distribution of performances for the top 10 athletes. Interestingly we see that the sprint events (100, 200 and to a slightly lesser extent 400) seem to have slower performances in 2020, compared to the average over 2016-2019 (distributions shifted to the right indicated slower performances). In comparison, the middle distance events (800, 1500) seem to have equivalent (and in some cases even slightly better) performances in 2020  compared to average from previous season. \n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Elite performance distributions for males and females and different events.](index_files/figure-html/elite-performances-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n### Sub-elite performances\n\nFigure \\@ref(fig:sub-elite-perfs) is the same plot as above, but those those athletes ranked 11-100. We see a similar trend in the sprint events, however the middle distance events also show a shift to the right, indicating slower than average performances for these ranks in 2020.\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Sub-elite performance distributions for males and females and different events.](index_files/figure-html/sub-elite-perfs-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nFrom this small investigation there are a few key things that stood out to me. Firstly, elite middle distance runners had an excellent year (performance wise) in 2020. This was true for both men and women. In contrast, sprint events were considerably down on their average performances in 2020. My personal take on this is that middle distance runners may have faired better during periods of lockdown compared to sprinters who _typically_ (I may be stereotyping here...!) make greater use of indoor facilities and therefore may have not been able to prepare as they normally would for the competitive season.\n\nFor sub-elite athletes (ranks 11 to 100), a consistent trend was apparent across all events, with performances in 2020 being down on the average performance over the last few seasons. This is probably due to a number of factors including, limited access to training facilities and far fewer opportunities to compete, not to mention all the other stresses that 2020 has brought.\n\nWhile this might all sound a little pessimistic, I know athletes are a hardy bunch and fully expect some exceptional performances in all events next year. The limited opportunities to compete this year, while certainly frustrating, may actually be a benefit in the long run... After all, a rest is sometimes as good as a run, and maybe this extended break from intense competition will be a blessing in disguise! \n\nThanks for reading!\n\n## Acknowledgments {.appendix}\n\nAs always, big thanks to the powerof10 team who provide an invaluable source for athletes and fans alike!",
