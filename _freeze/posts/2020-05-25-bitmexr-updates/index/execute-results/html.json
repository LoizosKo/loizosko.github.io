These actions are supported by the following functions:\n\n- `place_order()`\n- `edit_order()`\n- `cancel_order` or  `cancel_all_orders()`\n\nSee the [package documentation](https://hfshr.github.io/bitmexr/reference/index.html) or the [BitMEX website](https://www.bitmex.com/api/explorer/) for details on what arguments can be used with each function.\n\n# Practice on the Testnet\n\nBitMEX has a fully functional Testnet exchange that lets you use a \"practice\" version of the live exchange. This is great for trying out a new trading idea or using trying these functions out in a risk free environment that is identical to the real thing.  Every function in `bitmexr` has a Testnet equivalent - simply use the \"tn_\" prefix to access the Testnet version of the function. For example:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplace_order(symbol = \"XBTUSD\", price = 5000, orderQty = 100)\n```\n:::\n\nWill place an order on the live exchange, whereas:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntn_place_order(symbol = \"XBTUSD\", price = 5000, orderQty = 100)\n```\n:::\n\nWill place the order on the Testnet exchange.\n\n# Authentication needed!\n\nIn order to use these new functions you must first obtain an API key and secret for the account you wish to use with `bitmexr`. With API key and secret in hand, you can add these to your ~/.Renviron file using:\n```\nbitmex_apikey = \"api key\"\nbitmex_apisecret = \"api secret\"\n```\nfor the live exchange or\n```\ntestnet_bitmex_apikey = \"testnet api key\"\ntestnet_bitmex_apisecret = \"tetsnet api secret\"\n```\nfor the Testnet exchange. \n\nSee the [Authentication vignette](https://hfshr.github.io/bitmexr/articles/authentication.html) for more details.\n\n# Extras\n\n## Speed boost \n\nWith authentication set up, `map_trades()` and `map_bucket_trades()` get a speed boost due to increased API limit when using authentication. Simply set `use_auth = TRUE` to get these functions running at 60 API call per minute.\n\n## Additional API endpoints\n\nFor additional API endpoints that don't have a dedicated API wrapper in `bitmexr`, it is possible use either:\n\n- `get_bitmex()` for additional GET requests\n\nand\n\n- `post_bitmex()` for additional POST requests.\n\nThese functions just need the path to the API endpoint and a named list of valid parameters for that endpoint. For example, you could use:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchat <- get_bitmex(path = \"/chat\", \n                   args = list(channelID = 1, \n                              reverse = \"true\"))\n```\n:::\n\nTo get the latest English trollbox chat data (not sure why anyone would want this, but it is possible!).\n\n# What next?\n\nCurrent ideas for a future release:\n\n- Support for easily placing bulk orders \n- Rstudio addin for easy order submission\n\nOf course, any feedback / ideas are more than welcome!
