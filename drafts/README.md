# Data-analysis-in-R

Here you can find all my work during "Statistical Reasoning for Behavioral Science" class of Dr Alexey Shpenev. 

Datasets used include but are not limited to: titanic dataset, gapminder, norms dataset, General social survey (GSS).

During the course: 
1. Grasped fundamental concepts of statistical inference at a level necessary to read behavioral and 
decision science articles and understand the methods used in these articles with a special emphasis on 
interpretation and being aware of their limitations. 
 
2. Practiced sound and rigorous statistical procedures for data collection and analysis both in 
experimental and observational settings and an understanding of the differences between them. Navigated
through the various statistical methods used and judgeed on their applicability for a specific setting.  
 
3. Navigated through the R environment, including the tidyverse framework and created efficient 
code for data management and statistical analysis of my own observational and experimental 
data. A special emphasis was made on developing programming skills necessary to 
successfully analyze the experimental data collected.
