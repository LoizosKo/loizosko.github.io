### Denver, Colorado-specific tips

Moving to a new city can be challenging. It would help if you did a
couple of things before going to a new place:

#### Find a place to¬†stay

-   Go to Facebook groups and look for groups that are relevant to
    housing. Draft a post of who you are, what you are looking for, and
    your budget, and post it out there. That helps in getting noticed.
    You can see an example here:

-   Go to [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/); message owners and try to
    get a long-term deal on their property.

-   Look via [Furnished Finder](https://www.furnishedfinder.com/); a
    platform designed to connect traveling healthcare professionals,
    such as travel nurses and therapists, with property owners offering
    furnished, short-term housing options. The website aims to provide
    healthcare professionals with convenient and affordable housing
    solutions for their temporary assignments, typically lasting 13
    weeks or more. You can still look there and let the owners know if
    you are not a healthcare professional.

#### Find your group of¬†people

Besides work, you might find it tough to meet new people who you share
interests with. A great way to do it is through the [Meetup
app](https://www.meetup.com/apps/); a platform designed to help people
connect with others who share similar interests and hobbies in their
local area. Users can join existing meetup groups or create their own
groups centered around specific interests. Members can browse and join
local groups, attend events, and engage with other community members.

#### Transportation

**Car**: Consider getting a car. It is THE main mean of transport here
in Denver, and in Colorado in general. It makes it super easy to go to
the mountains, to get around, and to other cities. If you are getting
around with other means it will take you A LOT of time. If you do not go
out frequently, Uber/Lyft ([get discount from my referral
here](https://www.lyft.com/i/LOIZOS79522?utm_medium=p2pi_iacc)) is the
way to go, which are not cheap but on my occasion still cheaper overall
than having one.

**Bike**: Denver is a bikable city. Short distances (less than 30min)
and not many street ups and downs. There are also nice bike trails (i.e.
[Cherry Creek trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm1inEbk8m4)), and
the streets are pretty safe to bike; there is space and good roads and
pavements. If you don't have a bike you can use [the Lime
app](https://lime.bike/referral_signin/RDYPQNW) to rent one or rent a
scooter on the spot.

**Bus/Metro/Train**: For these, there is a centralized app that you can
download to make it easy to transport around; the RTD app. See this
video for more details on how to use it '[How to Navigate the Denver RTD
System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh3TPgrabNM)'.

#### Sketchy Neighborhoods

While Denver is a safe city overall, as in any big city there are some
areas in which you need to be more cautious. Here are the areas below,
in case you want to stay out of trouble or get into a breathtaking
adventure:

-   Colfax Street: especially east Colfax near the Aurora area and West
    Colfax near Sloan's Lake.

-   Market and 16th Street Mall at night

-   Capitol Hill area at night; and during the day near the bus stops.

#### Backpacker tips

**Gym**: [Planet
Fitness](https://www.google.com/maps/search/planet+fitness/@39.73753,-105.1026961,11z/data=!3m1!4b1)
is the cheapest one (\$10 membership‚Ää---‚ÄäApril 2023), and with branches
all over America can be a good deal for you. I was going to [Carla
Madison Recreation
Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Carla+Madison+Recreation+Center/@39.7376684,-104.9790875,13.06z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c7eb4ef5cde93:0xcab529897043406!8m2!3d39.7403159!4d-104.9585392!16s%2Fg%2F11g9q3w_z5)
as it was closer to me and the membership was reasonable;
\$30/month‚Ää---‚Ää50% off if you go with someone who lives at the same
address! So go ahead and find yourself a roommate as well:)

> If you are there for a short time or you are indecisive, you can go
> for one-day trial to each of those PLUS [Anytime
> fitness](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Anytime+Fitness/@39.7376538,-104.9790875,13z/data=!3m1!4b1),
> and get some free exercise while deciding.

**Supermarket**: Cheapest one from the chains is [Trader
Joe's](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Trader+Joe%27s/@39.737297,-105.1026968,11z/data=!3m1!4b1).
Whole Foods, Sprouts, and Safeway are expensive, Kings Soopers is
slightly less than them; Walmart is also there, and a bit more
affordable than Target (which is also expensive). Not sure if there is a
cheaper non-chain option; haven't looked much for it because they are is
none within a 25-minute bike radius from my house.

**Shopping**: [Ross Dress for
Less](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Ross+Dress+for+Less/@39.7390059,-104.9858976,12z/data=!3m1!4b1)
has value-for-money deals when it comes to clothing. Also, check out
[DWS](https://www.google.com/maps/search/dws+denver/@39.7299843,-105.0661523,11.55z)
if you are looking for shoes.

**Haircut**: [Aveda Institute
Denver](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aveda+Institute+Denver/@39.7291358,-105.0031187,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c78d0deb31797:0xfaf039a3d253248b!8m2!3d39.7291358!4d-105.0005438!16s%2Fm%2F0h7glkh),
a school cosmetology/beauty saloon, is the cheapest place. You can get a
haircut for \$20 (as of April 2023). Demand is high so reservation in
advance is encouraged. You can get it for even cheaper if you call them
to pre-book and ask for the 10% discount üòâ

**Shoe soles**: This is more specific but it might be helpful. Having
comfortable soles is important for your feet. After the advice of
Margaret, a serial hiker (especially her husband), I went to [Fleet
Feet](http://This%20is%20more%20specific%20but%20it%20might%20be%20helpful.)
to get soles for my shoes. Without knowing much about foot science, this
place seems solid. They make you stand in a digital machine that takes
measurements of your feet, and they propose some solutions for you. You
can also get the results via email if you'd like. Also, prices are
decent (\$50-\$60 as of May 2023 for a normal pair of soles).
