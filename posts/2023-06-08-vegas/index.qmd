### Day 1 --- Denver to Chinle

The journey began in Denver, Colorado. Destination for
the day was the Thunderbird Lodge Hotel, situated in Chinle, Arizona,
about an eight-hour drive from Denver without accounting for stops.

Our first stop, approximately two hours into the trip, was [Fairplay,
Colorado](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairplay,+CO+80440/@39.2252633,-106.0015233,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x876ae842e247da0f:0x70597e9aed63730!8m2!3d39.2247125!4d-106.0019618!16zL20vMHJjYjc?entry=ttu). Fairplay is the real-life inspiration for the popular animated show South Park, and it showcases this duality of character quite effectively. One section of
the town features classic wild western-style houses, while another
displays brightly colored homes reminiscent of those in the cartoon.
Went to the South Park Brewery for lunch. An interesting nugget of
information from the bartender: the name 'South Park' originates from
the region, not the show, and referencing the cartoon in the restaurant
could land them in hot water, legally. That's why they had no references from the show.

Back on the road, we covered substantial ground before making our next
stop at Chick Fil A in Farmington, New Mexico. Many people were there;
Americans are crazy for fried chicken.

The rest of the journey to Chinle was made under a beautiful evening dessert scenery. We finally reached the [Thunderbird Lodge
Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/nKSLeoXjyB3QxSnV6) at 11 pm. It was a long
drive, but the combination of diverse landscapes, engaging stops, and
pleasant people made the day an excellent start to our road
trip.

### Day 2 --- Grand Canyon National Park

Woke up to a view of a calming garden at our motel For breakfast, we
visited a nearby spot, breakfast chain
[Dennis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Denny%27s/@36.0346687,-109.6764784,10.66z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sdennis+breakfast!3m6!1s0x873a9d5eb23400fd:0xb854b9ff12411fc8!8m2!3d36.1564208!4d-109.5637052!15sChBkZW5uaXMgYnJlYWtmYXN0WhIiEGRlbm5pcyBicmVha2Zhc3SSAQVkaW5lcpoBJENoZERTVWhOTUc5blMwVkpRMEZuU1VOeGNEWmZhWHBuUlJBQuABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11ckxmh2j5?entry=ttu),
for a delicious/extra calorific meal.

On the road once again, four-hour drive to
Grand Canyon National Park, reaching the Grand Canyon Visitor Center
around 1 pm. Interestingly, we discovered an entrance fee of \$35 for
the day, or \$70 for an annual pass. This fee granted us access to park
our vehicle and utilize the convenient bus transportation system that
shuttled visitors to various points within the canyon --- there is a bus
every 15 minutes at the points of the Canyon. Bike rentals were
available as well, at a cost of \$40 per person for a
two-hour duration. The summer heat, which could reach up to 46 degrees
Celsius, so if you go, go prepared. There are a lot of signs that say
do not overestimate your abilities because the hikes down the Canyon can
get challenging really fast. The heat is too much, you need extra water,
salty snacks, and sunscreen 100%, if you want to make your life easier.

![Grand
Canyon](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/1*QYqo3PjNSomcjSyP_cS0_A.jpeg)

Keep in mind, you take double the time to climb up than going down so it
is wise to stop when you reach at 1/3rd of your energy capacity. Every
year, approximately 150 people are rescued by helicopter. This is not to
say that it is not a doable challenge, but if you plan to hike far, come
prepared.

#### Things to take with you on dessert hike trips

-   Hat (brimmed hat preferably)

-   Water/ Water bottle

-   Sunscreen

-   Sunglasses

-   Snack bars --- salty snacks for keeping electrolyte balance

-   First aid kit

Upon parking, we proceeded to [Yavapai
Tavern](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yavapai+Tavern/@36.0544506,-112.1220829,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x873310bd869c3269:0x8e5e6b4e589d7fec!8m2!3d36.0544506!4d-112.119508!16s%2Fg%2F11cm0x4bzt?entry=ttu)
for lunch. The pizza we tried not recommended due to its
small size, suggest the burger instead. You dont have many options anyway, it is one of the few restaurants you will find around there.

Next, we boarded a bus from the main station, and there we saw for the
first time Grand Canyon. That was the highlight of the day because the
magnitude of it gets you by surprise. You can see pictures of it, but experiencing it is something totally different. You get the feeling of insignificance. It is a sightseeing with 2 billion years of history.

We took the red line bus to [Hermit's
Rest](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hermit%27s+Rest/@35.6041269,-111.22678,9.94z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x873317b4f63d309b:0xaf381f5435420802!8m2!3d36.0620738!4d-112.2111861!16zL20vMDZ3cDJ4?entry=ttu), where we explored the area. Walked around and took some pictures.

![Grand Canyon
Rim Trail](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/1*nwCIIkr0uU-pwyyVZbEm1A.jpeg)

Concluding the day, we took on the Rim's Trail, a 3-kilometer path that
closely follows the edge of the canyon. Spent time in the canyon
before departing around 7 pm for next motel, the [Aztec
Motel](https://goo.gl/maps/TWAG7CqbLxxuFYvQ7) in Seligman. Along the
way, made a stop at a
[KFC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/KFC/@35.2935232,-112.4563148,10z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1skfc!3m6!1s0x87329f1fef3a9979:0xdec3e9bb486a91cc!8m2!3d35.2574747!4d-112.1912358!15sCgNrZmMiA4gBAZIBEmNoaWNrZW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F1tgz5z44?entry=ttu)
and a gas station nearby. Arrived at the hotel by 9 pm along the iconic
Route 66. 

Some other worthwhile places to admire Grand Canyon's view are the
following:

-   [Grand Canyon West
    Skywalk](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Canyon+West+Skywalk/@36.7098077,-113.9750363,7.78z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x80cc13a93577432b:0xe7935e32d9a9e4!8m2!3d36.011943!4d-113.8108372!16zL20vMDkzdzdr?entry=ttu):
    The Skywalk is 70 feet long and extends out over the rim of the
    Grand Canyon, providing unobstructed views straight down to the
    canyon floor 4,000 feet below. The glass floor of the Skywalk offers
    a unique perspective and makes it feel like you're walking on air.

-   [Horseshoe
    Bend](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Horseshoe+Bend/@36.7098077,-113.9750363,7.78z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87346ced52b21091:0xb623646960566829!8m2!3d36.8790612!4d-111.5103627!16zL20vMDZucWhq?entry=ttu):
    This iconic viewpoint overlooks the river from a height of about
    1,000 feet, offering a breathtaking panorama that has become a
    poster image for the American Southwest. The curve of the river
    creates a horseshoe-like shape, hence the name. To reach the viewing
    area, visitors must hike a 1.5-mile round-trip trail from the
    parking area. It's a relatively easy hike, but it can be hot in the
    summer, so it's recommended to bring water and sun protection. The
    view is well worth the effort, but do take care near the edge as
    there are no railings. Remember, this is a very popular site and can
    get crowded, especially during the peak tourist season. It's often
    photographed at sunrise or sunset when the light brings out the
    vibrant colors of the rocks.

### Day 3 --- Route 66 and exploring Las Vegas

Day started with a simple motel breakfast, setting out on
the road by 9 am. The drive along Route 66 from Seligman to Las Vegas
was an exceptionally smooth ride. Great road to drive for three reasons, straight, very few cars, and a nice dessert scenery.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/1*WtSM4w45KytrlXHWIzWviw.jpeg)

Arrived in Las Vegas around 11:30 am, checked into our hotel, the
Fairfield Inn, before going for lunch.
Our chosen restaurant was the [Mint Indian
restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mint+Indian+Bistro/@36.1151056,-115.2240105,13z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1smint+indian+las+vegas!3m6!1s0x80c8c4513133718f:0x210407d1b7ee26dd!8m2!3d36.1151056!4d-115.1477928!15sChVtaW50IGluZGlhbiBsYXMgdmVnYXMiA4gBAVoXIhVtaW50IGluZGlhbiBsYXMgdmVnYXOSARFpbmRpYW5fcmVzdGF1cmFudOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F1thxqx_j?entry=ttu),
located a mile away. Although the heat reached 115 degrees Fahrenheit or
46 degrees Celsius, we walked there (1 mile) --- DO NOT DO THIS, you
might get a headache, and it is not a pleasant experience. Regarding the
restaurant, the flavor variety of the authentic all-you-can-eat buffet
made it well worth the journey. Definitely recommend it, especially if
you are seeking South Indian cuisine.

Following our meal, made our way to the renowned casinos along the
[Las Vegas Strip](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3GhlFytOzv8), such as
Bellagio, Caesars Palace, Paris, The Venetian, etc. Immersed in the
vibrant atmosphere, we tried our luck at roulette. On our way back we
got bubble tea from [Happy
Lemon](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Happy+Lemon+-+Grand+Bazaar+Shops/@36.1124615,-115.1810072,15z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1s+bubble+tea!3m6!1s0x80c8c5892a3b10df:0x2bba8080e1239039!8m2!3d36.1137696!4d-115.1721333!15sCgpidWJibGUgdGVhWgwiCmJ1YmJsZSB0ZWGSARBidWJibGVfdGVhX3N0b3JlmgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVVJvTkVwWVRWcDNFQUXgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11tsrst1h9?entry=ttu)
before returning to our hotel.

![Las
Vegas Strip](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/1*mkyELqSIH3dLIgl8IBH1Eg.jpeg)

After a restful break from 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm, we embarked on our
evening adventures. Downtown Vegas, particularly Fremont Street, offers
a distinct and lively hippie vibe, featuring an array of parties and
vibrant lights. This area is certainly worth exploring for anyone
visiting Las Vegas. Our next destinations included the iconic Las Vegas
Sign and the Luxor Hotel with its pyramids. Returning to the Bellagio,
we saw the water fountain display before going for dinner at [Buffalo
Wild
Wings](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Buffalo+Wild+Wings/@36.1260934,-115.1871472,13.4z/data=!3m1!5s0x80c8c4312e55848f:0xff95595e3640e30b!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sBuffalo+Wild+Wings+las+vegas!3m6!1s0x80c8c430d94aa0fd:0x1ade2572a80c6802!8m2!3d36.1082936!4d-115.1716424!15sChxCdWZmYWxvIFdpbGQgV2luZ3MgbGFzIHZlZ2FzIgOIAQFaHiIcYnVmZmFsbyB3aWxkIHdpbmdzIGxhcyB2ZWdhc5IBGGNoaWNrZW5fd2luZ3NfcmVzdGF1cmFudOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11bwkfcwtc?entry=ttu).
The next stop was Caesars Palace, with the aim of reaching the roof for
a breathtaking view. Although we managed to ascend to the 47th floor, a
locked door prevented us from accessing the rooftop. Nonetheless, we
continued to explore the casino, which had various games such as
roulette, blackjack, and slot machines.

#### Vegas tips

If you plan to gamble in Las Vegas, it's advisable to bring cash to
avoid the casino's ATM's \$10 withdrawal fee. Additionally, for
international visitors, carrying your passport or state ID is
recommended, as some instances may require them for entry. Although
there is no strict dress code in casinos, it is advisable to use common
sense when choosing attire.

Given the warm weather in Vegas, it is essential to have water,
sunscreen, and a hat when walking during the day. To avoid purchasing
bottled water, request a cup from a restaurant, preferably a fast food
chain, and get it at no cost. If you like paying, casinos typically
charge for water.

Concluding our day, we returned to our hotel, and rested, to be prepared
for the final day of our road trip, driving back home on Day 4.

### Day 4 --- Journey Back to Denver

Day 4 marked the final leg of our epic road trip as we embarked on an
11-and-a-half-hour drive covering a distance of 750 miles, returning to
Denver from Las Vegas. Leaving Las Vegas behind, we traversed through
the captivating landscapes of Utah.

***Fun Fact***: Utah is home to five national parks known as *the Mighty
5.* These parks include Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park,
Capitol Reef National Park, Arches National Park, and Canyonlands
National Park. Each park offers its own unique natural wonders, from
towering sandstone cliffs to stunning arch formations.

During our journey, we made a bubble tea/ gas stop at Grand Junction,
Colorado. As the day advanced, we steadily progressed and eventually
arrived back in Denver by 10:15 pm.

#### **Conclusion**

I hope the tips that accompany this article prove helpful to your plans
in crafting your own trip in the future.

Safe travels and happy exploring!
