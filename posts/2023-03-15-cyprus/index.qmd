Are you planning a trip to the island of goddess Aphrodite? From
beautiful beaches to majestic mountains, Cyprus is a place where you can
do a wide variety of activities. In this article, you will find details
such as currency, transportation, restaurant recommendations, cultural
visits, and cool activities you can do. Cyprus is sunny more than 300
days a year, however, remember to check the
[weather](https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+cyprus&source=lmns&bih=636&biw=1181&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLuajxy-_8AhV9u3IEHR7IBM0Q_AUoAHoECAEQAA)
before arriving.

## CURRENCY

The main currency is Euro. [Live currency
converter](https://www.google.com/search?q=dollar+to+euro&ei=iuDXY-rIKIyaptQPmM6IiAI&ved=0ahUKEwjqte-vzO_8AhUMjYkEHRgnAiEQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=dollar+to+euro&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzILCAAQsQMQgwEQkQIyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCRAjIFCAAQkQIyBQgAEJECMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6BQgAEKIEOgYIABAIEB46BQgAEIYDSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUNcCWI8SYNAWaAFwAXgAgAH5AYgBkwqSAQUwLjEuNZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp).
They accept card payments everywhere. If you have a foreign currency,
with Revolut you should be fine. Keep in mind that the north of the
island (37%) is occupied by Turkey since 1974, therefore, Turkish Lira
is what was adopted and is still in use in that part of the island.

## TRANSPORTATION

The most efficient way to transport in Cyprus as a tourist would be to
rent a car. This offers the flexibility to explore the island at your
own pace, and reach remote destinations that may not be accessible by
public transportation. *Remember, people left-hand side of the road,
like in the UK. It is recommended to book your rental car in advance,
especially during peak tourist season, to ensure availability and secure
a better rate.*

**Taxis** and **buses** are also options; While you might not be as
flexible as with a car, buses at least can be cheaper --- [routes and
schedules](https://www.cyprusbybus.com/default.aspx).

## BEACH

There are different kinds of beaches in Cyprus. The most popular among
Cypriots are in Protaras and Ayia Napa area. Here are some options for
you:

[Marcelo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marcello's+Beach+Bar,+Cafe/@34.9842853,34.0079002,16.69z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14dfc51a4984a54d:0xea4b5cdd2d27ab3b!8m2!3d34.9842606!4d34.0105667!16s%2Fg%2F1tfljgr4)
(wavy with some rocks. More popular for students).

[Fig tree

(sand only, with a more shallow surface. More popular for families).

[Yianna Marie
Beach](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yianna+Marie+Beach+Bar/@35.0200585,34.0492571,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14dfc41c8dd8a291:0xc4052d6f28ffb29f!8m2!3d35.0200586!4d34.0509219!16s%2Fg%2F1jkw999qk)
(This is something hybrid between the two prementioned beaches and one
of the top preferences of locals. Here there is sand, not wavy with
occasional rocks.)

For nice scenery, you can visit Cape Greco, where you can see sea caves.
There are also people that are swimming in the crystal clear waters
there, and some risk-loving people that dive from the Cape Greco cliff
in the sea (not recommended).

## NATURE

For greenery and nature, you can go to [Troodos National Forest
Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN8OOwNJtrM) around Mount Olympus.
It is an area of outstanding natural beauty, suitable for activities
such as hiking, winter skiing, biking, nature study, camping, and
picnics. The highest point is Chionistra (1,952 m) and the lowest is
Moni forest (700m).

## ACTIVITIES

üö≤ Biking Nicosia's Cycling route park, Pedieos linear park. It goes
from Anthoupoli (Nicosia suburb) to downtown. Arguably, one of **the
most underrated experiences**, it is a 14km(8.6 miles) ride with a lot
of greenery, city nature, runners, and cats. You can also walk here on
its pedestrian side.

[Pedieos Linear Park - click

üé≥ Bowling at [Kykkos

It is the only bowling place in Nicosia. With \$6/game you can have fun
while showing off your talent.

‚öΩ Football. If you are five people, you can call in advance one of the
following football futsal fields and they will find you opponents to
play against;
[Paeek](https://www.google.com/search?q=paeek+lakatamia+futsal&ei=lfDXY7b2NLCqptQPkoyaiAM&ved=0ahUKEwj2lKvW2-_8AhUwlYkEHRKGBjEQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=paeek+lakatamia+futsal&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgcIABAeEKIEMgcIABAeEKIEOgoIABBHENYEELADOgcIABCwAxBDOg8ILhDUAhDIAxCwAxBDGAE6DAguEMgDELADEEMYAToHCC4Q1AIQQzoFCAAQgAQ6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOg0IABANEIAEELEDELEDOgcIABANEIAEOgUIIRCgAToHCCEQoAEQCjoFCCEQqwJKBAhBGABKBAhGGAFQkgRYyRZg1RhoAXABeACAAZUCiAGSHpIBBDItMTeYAQCgAQHIARHAAQHaAQYIARABGAg&sclient=gws-wiz-serp),

üî´ [Paintball](https://paintballcyprus.com/). While it is more expensive
than the rest of the activities (\$25/person) is a fun group activity
--- min 8 people.

üíª Remote working / Reading.

is a great place to work remotely from. It is a quiet co-working space
and in the heart of Nicosia. Another quiet place you can go is the
[library of the University of
Cyprus](https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+of+Cyprus+Library-Stelios+Ioannou+Learning+Resource+Center/@35.1470032,33.4097377,17z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x14de194095a2169f:0x23532e046f201d80!8m2!3d35.1468248!4d33.4124188!16s%2Fg%2F1t_gbht2?entry=ttu).
Moreover, you can go to one of the multiple coffee shops in Cyprus
[Nero](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Caff%C3%A8+Nero/@34.7902162,32.9698697,8z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu),

(less quiet but more social).

## FOOD `min $ /max $$$$`

ü•ñ
[Zorbas](https://www.google.com/maps/search/zorbas+cyprus/@34.9296734,32.6739001,9z/data=!3m1!4b1)

`$` One of the most traditional you can find. It is in a small village
