ü•û [Magnolia

`$$` Simple and neat. Not many options in the menu, but not little. Just
about right and the description is very clear on what they offer. Great
vibe in the restaurant. Magnolia's table is owned by the famous Chip and
Joanna Gaies who are well knowned from the popular "[Fixed
Upper](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4591390/)" TV series which was
nominated for two Primetime Emmies awards. ![Magnolia\'s
Menu](images/magnoliam.jpg) The idea for Magnolia Table was born out of
Chip and Joanna's love for hospitality and creating spaces where people
can gather and connect. They wanted to bring their unique style and
vision to the restaurant scene, offering a comfortable and welcoming
atmosphere for guests.

The building that houses Magnolia Table has a rich history of its own.
It was originally a historic Elite Cafe, a well-known restaurant in Waco
that had been serving customers since 1919. Chip and Joanna Gaines
acquired the property and renovated it to transform it into Magnolia
Table, preserving the building's character and charm. ![Elite Cafe in
the 1920s](images/elite.jpeg)

The renovated version of the restaurant first opened its doors in 2018
and quickly became a popular dining destination in the area. The menu at
Magnolia Table features a variety of breakfast and brunch dishes, with a
focus on fresh and locally sourced ingredients. Beyond its food
offerings, Magnolia Table is known for its beautiful interior design.
Chip and Joanna have infused their signature style into the space,
creating a rustic yet modern ambiance with farmhouse-inspired decor.

üçñ [Vitek's
BBQ](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vitek's+BBQ/@31.5670686,-97.3173828,12.28z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x864f8231185d7ffd:0x60376158c64c02ec!8m2!3d31.5363889!4d-97.1283333!16s%2Fg%2F1thzp9mm?entry=ttu)
`$$` Vitek's BBQ is a renowned barbecue restaurant located in Waco,
Texas. It has a rich history that dates back several decades. The
restaurant was established in 1915 by Slovak immigrant William Martin
Vitek and has remained in the Vitek family ever since.
![https://www.viteksmarket.com/about/](images/viteks.jpeg) Originally
known as Vitek's Grocery Store, the business started as a small corner
store that sold basic groceries and household items. Over time, Joe
Vitek decided to expand the store's offerings by adding a barbecue pit
and serving smoked meats to customers. This decision proved to be a
turning point for the business, as the barbecue became incredibly
popular among locals and visitors alike.

In 1972, the name changed from Vitek's Grocery and Meat Market to
Vitek's BBQ. In 1983, Vitek's most famous offering was created: the "Gut
Pak." The Gut Pak is a hearty combination of smoked sausage, chopped
beef, pickles, onions, and jalapenos served on a bed of Fritos corn
chips. While it was recommended to us by the hotel receptionist, that
day it was closed so we went to Rudy's Bar-B-Q instead.

`$` American chain restaurant for brisket. Not amazing but not bad.
Rudy's Bar-B-Q is a popular chain that originated in Leon Springs,
Texas, near San Antonio in 1989. While Rudy's Bar-B-Q has expanded to
various locations across Texas and other states, including Waco, it
started as a small country store with a barbecue pit.

\$\$--- The Salt Lick BBQ is an iconic barbecue restaurant located in
Driftwood, Texas. Established in 1967 by Thurman Roberts, Sr., and his
wife Hisako, its roots trace back to the mid-1800s when Thurman's
ancestors settled into the Texas Hill Country. They perfected a unique
barbecuing method involving open flames instead of the more common
indirect heat method.¬†

![The Salt
Lick¬†BBQ](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*2gpQpD5BbVfG2hYA.jpg)

Drawing inspiration from a family recipe, Thurman and Hisako opened The
Salt Lick with the goal of offering great food and a memorable
experience. Over the years, it has gained immense popularity, becoming a
must-visit spot for BBQ enthusiasts. It's famous not only for its rich,
smoky meats but also for its BYOB (bring your own beer) tradition and
the picturesque vineyard setting. With more than 15,000 reviews Salt
Lick maintains a tradition that Texans honor.

## [SEGUIN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Seguin,+TX+78155/@29.5979128,-98.0306122,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x865cb81a303bfdc7:0x9ad8d00ad149d44c!8m2!3d29.5689248!4d-97.9645832!16zL20vMDEwMjRf?entry=ttu)

`$` Texan flags, stars, baseball and football shirts, wooden tables, it
doesn't get more American than that. Huge portions. Good place for the
vibes and if you are hungry. If someone that respects food opened a
local fast food that's how would look like. It's chicken wings though
were mediocre. ![Everything is big in Texas -pic before eating at Rocket
Wings Dixie Grill](images/dixies.jpeg)

üçñ [Burnt Bean

`$$` Heard great things about it from local scientists at GBRA Lab in
Seguin. Popular place among the locals with lines for BBQ. It earned a
place at "[The Texas Bucket
List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlYOTWo1o38&t=102s)".

The restaurant opened in January 2021. It did not take long to take off.
Ernest Cevantes, the founder, mentions that his "claim to fame" can be
explained by competition BBQ. Specifically he won 45 out of 50 great
champions and everything you can win in Texas. He partnered up with one
of his competitors in competition BBQ, David Kirkland.

## [MINGUS](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mingus,+TX+76463/@32.5262846,-98.5010913,11.15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x86519c2486a43ae7:0x405a9e1c33d8df0f!8m2!3d32.537908!4d-98.4222732!16zL20vMDEwN2hz?entry=ttu)

A fine dining restaurant with many years of history. It seems well
established as it features in the popular YouTube channel"[The Texas
Bucket List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDYS9u6I0O4)".

![Beneventi\'s Restaurant mid-May 2023](images/italians.jpeg) The owner
of the restaurant is an Italian immigrant. He arrived in Ellis Island in
New York, got in a train, and migrated in the town of Mingus in 1906. He
bought the place, and it started as a grocery store. It was bought on
site for \$88 and it came with four little girls and one of them became
his wife. That building is about 160 years old.

You can tell that the place has a history as you can see some of the
tomato sauces they used to sell back in the time. That is super cool,
probably my favorite place out of all because of the historical vibes.
We did not eat there since we were on our way to another town, I got the
unsweetened iced tea, freshly made and tasty.

## [STRAWN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Strawn,+TX+76475/@32.5498717,-98.5091826,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x86517631d5ac0c29:0x5df8a03771e99012!8m2!3d32.5520737!4d-98.498109!16zL20vMDEwN2oz?entry=ttu)

üçñ [Mary's
cafe](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mary's+Cafe/@32.5498717,-98.5091826,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x8651763c4cb1fe77:0x8417753e3c170b36!8m2!3d32.5498414!4d-98.4985007!16s%2Fg%2F1v3dsjxy?entry=ttu)
Quite popular restaurant in the area. The restaurant is popular for its
chicken fried steak. Fun fact, Mary serves over 200 thousand pounds of
potatoes and 50 thousand pounds of steak every year; this means 137
pounds (=62kg) of steak and 548 pounds (247kg) of potatoes per day!

Mary got her first job at the (only) other restaurant in the city after
the 8th grade. In 1984, Mary started working in that restaurant which
back then it was called "The polka dot". By 1986 she owned the place and
renamed it to ü•Å... "Mary's Cafe"! In the "[The Texas Bucket
List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5JGc1dtqfg)" video it says that
Mary does it all and I can confirm that she at least does the waiter
job; she was the one that took our order. I got the 'chicken fried
chicken' and got to try the 'steak fried chicken'. To be honest, I did
not like either of these because I felt that the oil and meat amount was
around 50%-50%, but what do I know, you go try and get your own opinion.

is a renowned convenience store and gas station chain that originated in
Texas. Founded in 1982 by Arch "Beaver" Aplin III and Don Wasek,
Buc-ee's started as a modest convenience store in Lake Jackson, Texas.
Unlike typical convenience stores, Buc-ee's stands out with its
oversized facilities, an abundance of gas pumps, immaculately clean
restrooms, and an extensive range of products from travel snacks to home
decor. Famous for their Beaver nuggets, jerky, and other proprietary
snacks, Buc-ee's has grown into a Texan travel institution.¬†

![Buc-ee's new store
opening¬†day](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1067/0*Rr6Cbm7JMfbgt5b3)

Their mascot, a beaver with a baseball cap, has become an iconic symbol
representing a unique blend of Southern hospitality and road trip
convenience. Over the years, Buc-ee's has expanded significantly and has
started to branch out beyond Texas borders, yet remains a beloved pit
stop for both locals and tourists.
