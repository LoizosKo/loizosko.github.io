    \[[*video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F950VZo6Y1I)\] --- Georgetown,
    was founded during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1859. It was named
    after George Griffith, a prospector who discovered rich silver
    deposits in the area. Georgetown's growth soared with the silver
    boom, and by the 1880s, it had become the center of the mining
    district. By the late 1890s, silver prices plummeted, leading to
    economic decline. Despite this, Georgetown managed to survive,
    thanks in part to its preserved Victorian architecture that drew
    tourists. Today, it's known for its historic charm and outdoor
    recreational opportunities.
