[Sam's ‚Ññ3
Glendale](https://www.google.com/maps/search/sam+s+no+3/@39.7077853,-104.9718348,13z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäDenver's favorite brunch place. They have 3 restaurants across
town, and all three of them have 4.4 stars minimum and more than 4,000
reviews on google. Sam's ‚Ññ3 was founded in 1927 by Sam Armatas, an
immigrant from Greece who sought to provide hearty meals to Denver
locals and visitors. The restaurant has a rich history and has been a
part of Denver's dining scene for over 90 years, making it one of the
city's oldest restaurants.

Huge portions and a ton of options. The only downside is that the menu
is without pictures so you can't know what you order unless you see
other people's dishes or try to find pictures from Yelp and google maps.

[Snooze an A.M.
Eatery](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Snooze+an+A.M.+Eatery/@39.3239101,-104.8183456,7.86z?entry=ttu)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäAnother famous brunch place. This is a chain that has in
multiple locations across the state (13 locations, mostly in Denver) and
the country‚Ää---‚Ääin Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas,
Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. They have all
the main brunch options you need, from eggs and sausages to pancakes and
waffles. They have better looking menu than Sam's but fewer choices.
Before you go make sure you join in their [benefits rewards
app](https://www.snoozeeatery.com/) so next time you go you get a \$10
off from your next meal. If you subscribe, it needs a day to get in
their system.

\$\$--- This European-style restaurant offers an extensive menu of both
sweet and savory crepes, catering to a variety of tastes and
preferences. From classic combinations like ham and cheese to unique
creations featuring Nutella, fresh fruits, and more, there is a crepe
for every craving. Crepes n Crepes was founded in 2001 by Julien and
Peggy Maingot, a husband-and-wife team who shared a passion for French
cuisine and the art of making crepes.

#### Lunch/Dinner

[Beau Jo's
Pizza](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beau+Jo%27s+Idaho+Springs/@39.7417271,-106.1262917,10z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sBeau+Jo%27s!3m6!1s0x876ba4b16af9b4e7:0xbb8e36657eb2efce!8m2!3d39.7417271!4d-105.5165505!15sCglCZWF1IEpvJ3MiA4gBAVoLIgliZWF1IGpvJ3OSARBwaXp6YV9yZXN0YXVyYW504AEA!16s%2Fg%2F1tffvf2w?entry=ttu)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäThis one is in Idaho Springs and the most famous pizza in
Colorado. Beau Jo's Pizza, famous for its distinctive Colorado-style
mountain pizzas, traces its roots back to the small mountain town of
Idaho Springs, Colorado. In 1973, a man named Chip Bair, who'd migrated
to Colorado from the Midwest, founded Beau Jo's.

The crust is so thick that it's common practice at Beau Jo's (actually
all over Colorado!) to drizzle honey on it, turning the pizza crust into
a delightful dessert. This unique style of pizza was quickly embraced as
"mountain pie," a fitting name given its origins and hearty nature.

The first Beau Jo's restaurant was a modest establishment, but it soon
gained popularity, particularly among those traveling to and from the
ski slopes. Beau Jo's pizza quickly became a Colorado tradition, a
must-visit for locals and tourists alike.

![14 pound pizza at
Beau¬†Jo's](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/1*Uuy6Ep0nQtkBwILB4UzR8Q.jpeg)

Beau Jo's Pizza is known for its "Beau Jo's Challenge." This eating
challenge involves consuming a 14-pound pizza (the "Grand Sicilian")
within one hour. If you can finish this massive pizza within the time
limit, the pizza is free, and you also win \$100 in cash. This challenge
is popular among competitive eaters and those who enjoy a good food
challenge. The waiter there told me that only 3% of people who try it
manage to eat all of it.

[Little
India](https://www.google.com/maps/search/little+india/@39.7086801,-105.2296472,12z?entry=ttu)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäIt seems they are two different Little India's, one that [has
multiple locations](https://www.littleindiaofdenver.com/) and one other
that is in [Lakewood area](https://littleindiadenvercolorado.com/). Both
offer almost the same items and both are awesome. Little India offers a
diverse menu featuring traditional Indian favorites. If you like spicy
food or flavor variety, this is a must-go-to location. Last time we
ordered with a colleague Saag with tofu, and the Chicken Korma, both 4/5
spicy (with 5 to be Indian Spicy), and I loved it.

[D'Corazon Mexican
Restaurant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/D%27Corazon+Mexican+Restaurant/@39.7617713,-104.995233,13.76z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c78c4f18ed9c9:0xddacc464adf52286!8m2!3d39.7500462!4d-104.9995509!16s%2Fg%2F1tgdjh19)
\$‚Ää---‚ÄäOnce you get in it feels like you are in Mexico. Big portions,
friendly staff, and tasty food. Free crisps serving starter is a plus.

[Method Coffee
Roasters](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Method+Coffee+Roasters+LoHi/@39.7621726,-105.0141074,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c792bcb1a42a5:0x6fab0f9c7cd03b37!8m2!3d39.7621726!4d-105.0115271!16s%2Fg%2F11f65723zx)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäGreat place to work/study. Locals come here to work and read
books. The atmosphere is relaxing, chill music, and plugs everywhere for
your laptop/devices.

[Chef
Zorba's](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chef+Zorba%27s/@39.7364253,-104.9594127,14.89z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c7eb12604b9a7:0x676b00adf250f6b8!8m2!3d39.735017!4d-104.955622!16s%2Fg%2F1tmy5k11)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäLocals love this place. While it is a popular dine-in
restaurant in the area, families and friend groups come here even for
brunch and breakfast. If you are wondering about the 'greekness' of the
place, menu is greek, gyros is not as good. Menu is pretty compatible
with authentic Greek food and portions are satisfactory.

[Downpours
Coffee](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downpours+Coffee/@39.7350422,-104.9601802,17.46z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x876b83fa3bf856e1:0xc25a9d7fc7ee9f6f!2sBristlecone+Shooting,+Training,+%26+Retail+Center+-+Shooting+Range+in+Denver!8m2!3d39.712573!4d-105.135754!16s%2Fg%2F11bbx4yt86!3m5!1s0x876c7eb11908c5f1:0x2e5637672609799c!8m2!3d39.7353429!4d-104.9547125!16s%2Fg%2F11c0xk4kkx)
\$‚Ää---‚ÄäMy favorite neighborhood cafe. It is my favorite because it is
quiet enough that you can study, but also social because many locals go
there, especially during the weekends. While it's open only from 7 am to
1 pm every day, it is a place that has space to sit inside and outside
with a beautiful street yard that also has charger plugs!

[Casa
Bonita](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Casa+Bonita/@39.7158706,-105.1101411,12.2z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876b87244758bb13:0xf939d1f0fd94ab49!8m2!3d39.7417583!4d-105.0706972!16zL20vMDRwcmsy)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäCasa Bonita, popular among locals Denver restaurant, reopened
in May 2023 under the ownership of the South Park creators. This unique
dining destination combines delicious Mexican cuisine with thrilling
entertainment, including cliff divers and live shows. People were going
there just for the cliff diver entertainment and cocktails because the
food used to be terrible. However, a new chef is there right now
determined to make it right. South Park [season 7, episode
11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1niwxxSHCiU&list=PLQYK_flETP5NZE0EHqIacFDwwFZFXe_jt)
features the restaurant.

\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäIf you are in a group of people where everybody feels like
eating something different, this is the place for you. It is a place
that has 10 restaurants of different cuisine varying from pizzas to
noodles to Mexican food and fried chicken. I had the noodles from the
Thai place and I have to say that the portions are pretty small for the
price. Same with the fried chicken. However, the pizzas are a proper
size. You can see it has a ton of reviews, while it's nice for me it was
a bit overrated.

[54Thirty
Rooftop](https://www.google.com/maps/place/54thirty+Rooftop/@39.733624,-105.001263,14.55z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x876c78d1054fe25b:0x4a880ef062d2143d!8m2!3d39.7442539!4d-104.993871!16s%2Fg%2F11g9vmxc2w)
\$\$‚Ää---‚Ää54Thirty Rooftop is a rooftop bar situated in the city of
Denver. Specifically, it is located on the 20th floor of the Le M√©ridien
Hotel in Denver and it is the highest open-air rooftop bar in the city.
From there you can see views of the city skyline and the Rocky
Mountains.

[Mehak India's

\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäFlavourful Indian food (Punjabi in particular). There is a
variety of options with different spices. If you do not like spices, no
worries; you can choose from 1 to 5 (five is Indian spicy). Worths to
give it a shot.

[Brooklyn's At Ball
Arena](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brooklyn%27s+At+Ball+Arena/@39.7482913,-105.0080281,17z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x876c78b866687b77:0x7bec273737d47786!2sBall+Arena!8m2!3d39.7486565!4d-105.0076028!16zL20vMDF3ZF83!3m5!1s0x876c78c7958313b1:0xac4bf6def88a5383!8m2!3d39.7471444!4d-105.0076962!16s%2Fg%2F1wz535xy?entry=ttu)
\$\$‚Ää---‚ÄäGreat bar to watch an NBA game. While tickets to basketball
games can be expensive, you can still live the atmosphere of a game by
going to Brooklyn's. It is a bar right next to the Ball Arena stadium
and the fan vibes there are the closest you can get to a basketball
match. [Check out the vibes from the Brooklyn's during a game by

[Snarf's](https://www.google.com/maps/search/snarfs+colorado/@39.7545122,-105.4616635,10z?entry=ttu)
\$‚Ää---‚ÄäA traditional Colorado sandwich place. My accounting manager who
lives in Denver says "Everything is good at Snarfs! If you are from
Colorado and you never had Snarfs people will start questioning you".
They have locations everywhere.

> The story of Snarf's began in 1996 when its founder, Jimmy "Snarf"
> Seidel, decided he wanted to create the world's finest sandwich.
>
> Tired of the corporate grind, Jimmy left his job as a broker in
> Chicago and moved to Boulder, Colorado. His quest was simple‚Ää---‚Ääto
> find the best sandwich out there. But his search was fruitless. So, he
> decided to take matters into his own hands and create the sandwich he
> was craving.
>
> He found an old house in Boulder, converted it into the first Snarf's
> location, and got to work creating the world's best sandwich. His
> creative creations, coupled with a fun and quirky ambiance, quickly
> won over the residents of Boulder. Today, Snarf's has grown to include
> multiple locations across Colorado, as well as Missouri, Illinois, and
> Texas.

you can pick a noodle or a rice base and then include your own selection
of ingredients in your bowl \~ or bowls, literally is all you can eat.
Then you give the bowl to the cook who makes the food in front of you.
