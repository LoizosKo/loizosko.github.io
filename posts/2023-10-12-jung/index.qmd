**If you are younger than forty**, hope Jung\'s quote below makes you
feel better.

**If you are older** and still doing research... what does Jung know?

He was doing research after 40; I mean, [he had 8
publications](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung/Character-of-his-psychotherapy)
after his 40th birthday. Do you think that was the case cause his name
alludes to a not old person? I highly doubt it.

**However, not everything revolves around you**. He might have just said
it for himself. If that\'s the case, it is different. Forty correlates
with about the time that he becomes a celebrity, so that might have to
do with this.

Well, feel free to clap üëè if you find this post helpful or inspiring.
