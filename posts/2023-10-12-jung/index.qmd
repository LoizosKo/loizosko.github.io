First of all HAPPY BIRTHDAY --> [Check out YOUR life stats HEREðŸ¤“ðŸ“Š](https://neal.fun/life-stats/)

**If you are younger than forty**, hope Jung's quote makes you feel
better.

**If you are older** and still doing research... what does Jung know? He
might be wrong.

He was doing research after 40; I mean, [he had 8
publications](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Jung/Character-of-his-psychotherapy)
after his 40th birthday. Do you think that was the case because his name
alludes to a not old person? I highly doubt it.

**However, not everything revolves around you**. He might have just said
it for himself. If that's the case, it is different. Forty correlates
with about the time that he becomes a celebrity, so that might have to
do with this.

Well, it's all about how we choose to look at it at the end of the day,
but anyways, hope you take a positive standpoint and enjoy your birthday
no matter how old you are becoming; HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
