In our modern society, the pursuit of productivity has become a revered
goal. We are constantly bombarded with messages and tips on maximizing
efficiency, optimizing our time, and accomplishing more in less time.
Does every second need to be exploited? Maybe. But definitely not in
this article. Here you will explore the exact opposite concept of how
can you make most (or ideally all) of your time useless.

What if we were to challenge this notion and explore the beauty of
embracing comfort and complacency? In this article, we delve into the
idea of deliberately slowing down and not stopping until you reach
nothingness. So, if you're ready to break free from the relentless
pursuit of productivity and discover the art of being less productive,
read on. It might just be the transformative shift you need to find
fulfillment in life 🤷

## 1. Focus on the things you can't control

Ponder over the weather, the options available in others' lives, and the
potential contributions they can make to your life, among other similar
topics. In other words, anything that is out of your control. Focusing
on things you can't control can create a mental and emotional burden
which translates in a productivity barrier. It consumes your thoughts
and energy, leaving you with less capacity to concentrate on the tasks
and responsibilities that are within your sphere of influence. This can
lead to a sense of stagnation and therefore inaction, as you become
consumed by circumstances beyond your reach.

Secondly, investing your time and energy in uncontrollable things can
distract you from taking proactive steps toward achieving your goals.
Hence, this can result in wasted time, and foster a strong inactivity
momentum. Focusing on things you can not control is a great way to stay
behind in many things in life.

## 2. One bird two stones

This is a great one. When you use two stones to kill a bird it implies that you are devoting more effort and resources than necessary, which can result in wasted time and energy. That can make you effectively inefficient.

You can blend in methods from the rest of the article tips to maximize that and you will be opening yourself doors of opportunity to successfully allocate your resources inadequately. It is important that you never underestimate yourself on that, you can always waste more time and energy. If you achieve something by being productive along the way try to realize step by step how you did it in order to avoid doing so next time.

You can take it a step further and kill one bird with more than two stones. This ensures that you delay as much as possible as you also maximize the time and energy you can waste. While this requires more effort, you can practice and test your limits.

## 3. Feed your procrastination urge; act on your impulses

This is crucial for achieving to maintain a status of complacency so
make sure to take notes here.

-   Observe your behavior and whenever you find yourself consuming
    something (in other words, sucking resources without giving anything
    back) you are in a good way. First, try to identify what that is.
    Let's take scrolling on social media as an example. As soon as you
    figure out that this maintains your stagnation levels, find ways to
    do that more. For instance, you can do that by adopting strategies
    such as having your phone next to you all the time and enabling
    notifications from every app you have; silent mode is your enemy
    here. If you don't have many distracting apps, try to download some;

    for a guide to the ones that can keep you the most from doing
    productive stuff. Distracting yourself from work by acting on your
    impulses is a great way to establish and maintain a complacent
    status.

-   Fear of failure: Procrastination can stem from the fear of failure
    or the pressure of meeting high expectations. Try to identify
    potential things that scare you about a task and foster them even
    more. Write the fear down and try to make it more scary for you.
    The more you can internalize the fear the highest the chances of
    staying like a wardrobe. In case you acknowledge that mistakes and
    setbacks are a natural part of the learning process try to forget
    that. Bringing yourself down is crucial for maintaining low
    contribution levels to society. Moreover, whatever the case DO NOT break the
    task into smaller steps, as it usually makes it harder to
    procrastinate.

-   Put off projects and deadlines as much as possible. As Oscar Wilde
    said: "Never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after".

## 4. Embrace chaos

No one that wants to stay away from productivity tries to be organized.
So try to learn from the masters by stopping yourself from time
management activities. Tools like Google Calendar and Notion are really
harmful to unproductivity. Having actionable steps and setting deadlines
is even worse. Instead, try to live for the moment and embrace the
adventure of the unknown. Enrich that behavior by delaying tasks and
putting them off until the last minute. In general, nothing from time
management principles helps you here.

Prioritizing, as long as it is done right, is the only thing that can be
helpful from the time management principles. How do you prioritize
staying unproductive? Identify which tasks are the most important to get
done and do them last. Especially when you work with others, you will
get a lot of attention and be amazed at how fascinated people will be
with your approach.

## 5. Eat sugar and fat

Diet is critical for performance. The saying "we are what we eat"
emphasizes the idea that the food we consume has a direct impact on our
physical and mental performance.

Sugar is vital for staying stagnant, the more you eat the more like a
plant you feel. Consuming high amounts of sugar, especially refined
sugars found in sweets and sugary drinks, can lead to energy crashes.
Initially, sugar provides a quick burst of energy, so try to restrict
the urge on doing stuff at that immediate moment. As long as you can
keep yourself calm the first moments, a rapid drop in blood sugar levels
follows, causing fatigue and a lack of focus.

Consuming high-fat meals, particularly those high in unhealthy fats like
saturated and trans fats, can leave you feeling sluggish and lethargic.
These foods take longer to digest, diverting energy away from your brain
and reducing mental clarity.

![Do not underestimate diet](images/fat.jpg)

Therefore, with fatigue, lack of focus, and mental clarity, you are
making it much easier for you to do less. Do not underestimate this
advice, especially if you want to become a professional procrastinator.

To be better at this, try to include in your shopping list as many of these products as possible. They are usually cheap as well. The secret here is to keep your fridge and stock full of these fat/sugary treats so you maintain easy access to them.

## 6. Talk more do less

This does two main things: 1) can maintain things stagnant for longer
periods of time, and 2) builds your reputation as a notorious
procrastinator.

On the first point, talking excessively without taking action can
solidify stagnation. Time spent in endless discussions or overplanning
without execution ensures that resources like time, and energy can be
drained effectively not only for you but also for the people that are
around you. Taking action is dangerous here because it allows us to test
our ideas, refine our strategies, and make necessary adjustments to
achieve tangible outcomes. This is something you want to avoid at all
costs! Bonus tip: Try to drag as many people to listen to you. One of
the most popular and effective ways to do so is to make any email a
meeting. In that way, you ensure that not only you does nothing tangible
but also your team members.

On the second point, by talking without doing you ensure that you are
not only doing nothing but also getting popular about it. This strategy
is called by professionals "talking the walk" and it is a renowned
method to brand yourself as a non-doer.

## 7. Challenge yourself carefully

This is tricky because as you challenge yourself in life you usually get
better at things and then you set higher standards. Challenge yourself
only in tasks that are carefully tailored in making you as inefficient
as possible in life. Being focused and picky on what you challenge
yourself at is crucial for maintaining the complacent status that you
work so hard to establish.

## 8. Suppress your productive motivation

When you are productively motivated about something, it does not let you
procrastinate much. Try to make the subject you are motivated about
uninteresting. One way you can do that is to isolate your connection
with it or make it difficult to get to. For instance, if you are
dedicated to going to the gym you can start by canceling your
subscription. Of course, your motivated self might not accept it that
easily so you might have to stay registered. If you face this kind of
resistance try to subscribe somewhere far from you that it is difficult
to get at.

![put barriers in productive motivation](images/barriers.jpg)

*Bonus tip: the more expensive the place you subscribe the better is for
maintaining low productivity status. That is because you use more of
your resources on something that does absolutely nothing.*

If your motivation resistance is strong, and you are pushed to work out at home, double down resistance by following point 5. You never go wrong by eating trash when it comes to combatting motivation. If your motivation resistance is extra strong do not worry, there are other ways to derail it. That is by trying to be a perfectionist. Take the example of Howard Hughes and you will realize the importance of it.

`The Spruce Goose, officially known as the Hughes H-4 Hercules, was a massive flying boat aircraft designed and built by Howard Hughes and his team during World War II. It was meant to serve as a transport aircraft for troops and supplies, and it was constructed primarily from wood due to wartime restrictions on aluminum. In 1942, the US government allocated to Hughes a budget of $18 million to build this aircraft for WW2.`

`While the original contract called for a two-year development period, it took over five years for the aircraft to be completed. Hughes was a perfectionist, and his relentless pursuit of an ideal design led to numerous delays and budget overruns. By the time it was finally built, the war had already ended, rendering the original purpose of the Spruce Goose obsolete.`

`The Spruce Goose made only one short flight in 1947, piloted by Hughes himself. After that, it never flew again. The massive aircraft became a symbol of Hughes's perfectionism and the significant results you get when you prioritize perfection over practicality.`

The Spruce Goose example demonstrates that the drive for perfection can lead to significant delays, increased costs, and inevitably to great success of being unproductive. So if you start working out by pure motivation for instance, try to perfect a technique of exercise, i.e. chest press, by using 0 weights and trying that (preferably without equipment) 1000+ times. Your unproductiveness will skyrocket.

## 9. Find something that makes you miserable

Misery tends to foster a specific mindset and self-talk, where you focus
on your problems, limitations, and failures. This thinking pattern
solidifies an attitude of not doing anything and leads to self-doubt
about you being able to do stuff. If you are able to find that in your
life, you automatically got into an express line to get fewer things
done.

## Conclusion

Try to celebrate times of complacency with long-lasting parties which
drag more resources and don't give something back to society. You will
know when you become really good at procrastination when you realize
that you are not even getting the parties done.

At that point you can spice things up by doing different unproductive
stuff you did not have the chance to do before such as watch movies,
stay up all night with no reason, go clubbing all day, play a ton of
videogames, spend money on dog food without having a pet and much more!
