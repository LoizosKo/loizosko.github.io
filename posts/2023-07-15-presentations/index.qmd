## Introduction

Are your presentations drawing too much interest? Do people hang on to
your every word, eagerly awaiting your next point? Do you find audience
members nodding in agreement or even chuckling at your jokes? If that's
the case, your presentations might be a little too interesting! Don't
worry though, I got you covered. This guide will help you make your
presentations less interesting and more forgettable. The article takes
you on a journey to learn the secrets of a dull presentation, breaking
all the rules of good storytelling and engaging conversations.

## 1. The more information the¬†better

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/533/0*LvfG7tPgoo_K2v6q.gif)

Data, data, and more data. Drench your audience in facts, figures,
statistics, percentages, ratios, quotients, calculations, measurements,
foreign characters, emojis, and whatever else you can integrate.
Ideally, every sentence should have at least one number. Ditch the
narrative. Who needs a story when you have the fourth quarter financial
report to discuss in excruciating detail? And remember, never explain
your data‚Ää---‚Ääcreate a good guessing game for the audience. Give them
all the data they never knew they didn't want to know.

## 2. Master your¬†phrasing

Avoid inflection or emotion in your voice. Speak at a steady pace
without variation. Use bullet points wisely. No, not one, not two, but
fifty bullet points per slide. Make it so overwhelming that the audience
can't remember where you started or where you're going. If you want to
go the extra mile, use mumbling. Don't articulate, don't modulate.
Mumble your words, and speak as fast as you can. Ensure that the last
person in the room can only hear a vague humming sound.

Bonus points if you use filling words during the pauses. While "eeehms",
and "aaahms" are usually people's go-to options feel free to be
creative.

## 3. Time limit, What's¬†That?

Run over your allotted time. Keep going. Don't stop. Time limits are for
weaklings. If your audience starts glancing at the clock or their
watches, you're doing it right. If you're given 15 minutes to present,
aim for an hour!

Remember, in the quest to deliver a truly monotonous presentation, time
is your greatest ally. The longer, more convoluted, and less structured
your presentation is, the better. Overwhelming your audience with the
quantity of information, rather than the quality, is a surefire way to
win the crown of "Most Boring Presentation."

> Muammar Gaddafi's infamous speech at the United Nations General
> Assembly on September 23, 2009, is remembered for its remarkable
> duration and significant time overrun. Instead of adhering to the
> designated 15-minute time limit, Gaddafi spoke for over 90 minutes,
> making it one of the longest speeches in UN history. His extended
> address surpassed the expectations of the audience. Gaddafi's
> disregard for time constraints contributed to the speech's notoriety
> and left a lasting impression on those in attendance.

## 4. Avoid Eye¬†Contact

Looking at your audience might make them feel seen, heard, and engaged.
We can't have that, can we? Keep your eyes firmly glued to your notes,
some distant point at the back of the room, or, better yet, your
shoelaces. Don't look at your audience.

Bonus tip: If someone asks a question or comments, definitely do not
make eye contact with them. This can give the impression that their
input matters or that you value their engagement, which is not what we
want in this case.

## 5. The Off-topic Odyssey

Why come to the point when you can take a delightful detour around it?
Feel free to venture off into a tangent that has nothing to do with your
main topic. Remember, your goal is to baffle, not inform. To "beat
around the bush" is your goal and you must stay determined. Keep your
audience guessing about the purpose of your talk. Bonus points if, by
the end, they've forgotten what the initial topic was. **Michael Scott**

## 6. Visuals: Ignite Confusion

Avoid the use of visuals, images, graphs, or anything that could make
the information more digestible or engaging. If can't hold the
temptation of using them, make sure you put a ton of them and make it
complex. The more complex, the better. And if you can, don't bother
explaining what they mean. Let the audience play 'Spot the X-axis' while
you enjoy their blank stares.

## 7. Avoid Interaction

Do not ask questions or encourage participation from the audience. Make
the presentation one-sided. Why ask for input when you can just lecture?
Make sure the audience members know they are there just to listen. Let
them daydream about the coffee break instead.

Also, make sure you skip the storytelling part. Who needs engaging
narratives or interesting anecdotes? Go straight to the facts and
figures, and strip them of any context or meaning. Remember, you're a
presenter, not a performer. Stand stiff and still. Avoid all hand
gestures and facial expressions.

> lectures were often sparsely attended, and there were instances where
> no one showed up at all. Newton's focus remained primarily on his own
> research and studies, neglecting his responsibilities as an educator.
> His disinterest in teaching his students contributed to his reputation
> as a disengaging teacher.

## 8. Terminology tornado

Why use one word when you could use ten? Why explain a simple concept in
layman's terms when you could dress it up with complexity? Spice it up
by using technical jargon and long-winded explanations that nobody can
follow. If somebody tries to ask a question, respond with an even more
technical and long-lasting explanation. With that, a way to tell if you
did well is if you see that the person who asked gets angry looks from
the audience.

## 9. No Personal Connection

Do not make any personal connection with the audience. Avoid sharing
personal experiences or anecdotes. That can make them feel that you
share things in common which might elicit curiosity and engagement. If
you think that is difficult, a great way to do so is to treat your
slides like a script and read it word for word. Pretend you are doing an
eye test. If you have extra confidence, try to make some mistakes while
reading, and go over some lines again. It's an absolutely splendid way
to put them off.

Laughter, smiles, a sense of fun‚Ää---‚Ääthese are frivolities you don't
have time for. Maintain the gravity of a state funeral. Remember,
nothing says 'interesting' like a presentation that feels like an
obituary reading.

## 10. The "What Just Happened?" Effect

Ensure your presentation lacks a clear introduction, body, and
conclusion. Jump randomly from one point to another. Make sure to repeat
yourself frequently, preferably in slightly different ways, for maximum
confusion and minimal impact. Keep your audience guessing when you might
actually finish. If you've done it right, they will be begging for the
end, staring at the clock, checking their phones‚Ää---‚Ääanything to
distract from the never-ending monologue that you've crafted.

For your grand finale, end abruptly. No summary, no conclusion, no
'thank you'. Leave them in a daze of confusion. After all, who doesn't
love a cliffhanger? Remember, the goal here isn't to summarize or make
impactful final points. No, it's to induce sheer boredom and perhaps
even a bit of existential dread.

## Conclusion

Armed with these 10 strategies, you are now equipped to master the art
of delivering uninteresting presentations. Embrace the power of boredom,
and watch as your audience struggles to stay awake and comprehend the
depths of tedium you have unleashed upon them. So go all in, and may
your presentations be dull. Stay monotonous, stay uninteresting, and
embrace the realm of mind-numbing monotony.
